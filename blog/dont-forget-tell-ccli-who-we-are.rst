Many churches use CCLI for licensing their music. It's the easy way to
stay legal. Every year, however, these churches need to submit what
songs they have used, and often also have to fill in a questionnaire
about how they use those songs...

The next time you have to fill in that questionnaire, don't forget to
point out that you use OpenLP! This has a direct benefit for you, as
users of OpenLP, because it means that we have enough users for them to
actually listen to us, and think about implementing things like
SongSelect differently, so that we can also add it to OpenLP.
