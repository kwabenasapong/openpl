The conflict merge went well last week, and I have a working copy of
openlp.org again. I've started the code cleanup, renaming various
components in the code, formatting the code to follow a certain standard
(rather than 3 different ones), and rearranging a few things as well in
the process. The goal behind the code cleanup is to make it easier and
faster to work on openlp.org, and to make openlp.org more efficient.

What this all translates to at the end of the day is that you as the
user will find openlp.org faster and more efficient, and when we need to
make a change or an enhancement, it'll be faster too.

Once I've completed the code cleanup, I'm going to continue with my
rewrite of the control component, which will enable us to do things like
use the up and down cursor keys to change between slides.

On that note, I know a number of folks have asked me for the components
so that they can make changes to openlp.org (I presume it's because
development is not happening fast enough for them, and they want certain
features for their church). Please chat with me and consider lending a
helping hand with the development. If you want feature A, I'm sure that
there are a number of other churches who also want feature A, and it
would be beneficial to them if you contributed that back to the project.
There are also a number of things you can and can't do with the current
codebase, and unless you chat with me and ask, you won't know and you'll
struggle unnecessarily (for instance, using the up and down cursor key
will only be possible after a rewrite of the control component).

In short, if you contribute back to openlp.org, not only do you benefit,
but others will too. You won't need to make changes to your version each
time a new version of openlp.org comes out, development will happen
faster, and others will benefit from your changes as well.
