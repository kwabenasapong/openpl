Hi folks, the long awaited release candidate 4 is finally here! A few
more features crept into this release candidate, you'll be pleased to
know, and we've fixed one or two other things that had the potential of
going wrong. Please have a good look at this release, test it out
thoroughly, and file bug reports in the appropriate bug reports forum
topic. This is hopefully our last RC before we release 1.0.

I also just wanna say a big thank you to all those people who have
responded to my call for documentation. We've got some good stuff lined
up, including a user manual that can be distributed with openlp.org, and
possibly also screen casts demonstrating how to use openlp.org.

This is probably the last post from me for a while. As some of you
already know, I'm getting married at the end of this month, and so I'm
concentrating my full efforts on preparing the wedding and accompanying
arrangements. Please keep us in your prayers.
