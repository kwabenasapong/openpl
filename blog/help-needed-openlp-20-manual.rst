Are you eager to help out with OpenLP but aren't a developer?

We need folks to help write the manual for OpenLP 2.0. You don't need to
be a developer, but a good working knowledge of how to do things like
set up dual monitors is essential. Experience with markup systems like
BBcode, Markdown or even HTML is an advantage, but not necessary.

So what does it entail?

Basically, you'll be writing up documentation in something called
reStructuredText, which is plain text with a little bit of markup. It
might sound pretty intimidating, but it isn't that complicated. You will
also need to work a little with Bazaar, the version control system we
use, but that's not that complicated either. And don't worry, we will
help you every step along the way.

Interested?

Send an e-mail to info [at] openlp.org with a subject line of "Help with
Manual" and your name, e-mail address, and username on the site.
