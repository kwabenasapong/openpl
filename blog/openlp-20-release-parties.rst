After much discussion, the developers have tentatively put the final
release of OpenLP 2.0 in mid-October this year. This is a very
auspicious occasion, since OpenLP 2.0 has been in development since
September 2008. So after 4 long hard years of work, we can think of no
better way to celebrate the release of OpenLP 2.0 than to throw a big
party.

Unfortunately, being much of a global affair, it will be rather
difficult to get everyone from around the world to the same place to
celebrate the release of OpenLP 2.0. A better solution would be for
people in various areas to host regional release parties.

There are a number of OpenLP `developers living in the
UK <http://openlp.org/en/forums/general-support/general-discussion/uk-20-release-party>`_,
and they are quite eager to get together for a release party. I live in
`Cape Town, South
Africa <http://openlp.org/en/forums/general-support/general-discussion/south-africa-20-release-party>`_,
and I'm keen to host a release party here in Cape Town too.

If you are interested in attending a release party, or hosting a release
party, please post your location in an appropriate release party topic
in the forums. If there isn't a release party topic, create one!

Remember that release parties do not need to involve computers at all!
You can get together at a local pub or restaurant, or host a bit of a
party at someone's house. The release parties don't have to happen on
the day of OpenLP's release either, they can be a week or two or three
later. If you have any ideas of how to celebrate OpenLP's release, feel
free to post your ideas in the forums too.
