Hi all,

For those of you out there that don't have musicians to play music for
your church service and use audio tracks, version 1.2.0 will be a
welcome surprise (since it wasn't in the project plan). Due to a
personal requirement, I continued development on the v1.x line of
openlp.org and added the facility to play audio files. Not only that,
but they can be linked to lyrics and managed together.

While I was busy with this I was in contact with CCLI in Germany and was
able to get information which enabled me to build in song import support
for SongSelect file (txt & usr).  I also added a web based facility to
import songs from SongSelect.  For those of you who use SongSelect, I'm
sure you will enjoy this.

I was also able to enhance the internationalisation capabilities of
openlp.org. This includes being able to select your language preference
when the First Run Wizard runs after installation.

In the process of development, a few bug fixes were also taken care of. 
For a more complete list of the changes, refer to the Changelog.

You can get your all new 1.2.0 edition from the download page.

Derek.

P.S. I should mention that other than urgent bugfixes, this really is
the last of the 1.x versions :)
