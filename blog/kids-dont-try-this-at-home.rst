I've done what any developer should NEVER do. I've released RC6 with a
few bugs that we know about.

Well, I wanted to give everyone a nice little Christmas present. The
latest version of openlp.org, with quite a few bug fixes. There are also
two new import/export functions.... one to import openlp.org songs, and
one to export openlp.org songs. Of course you can download openlp.org
from the Download page. Bug reports in the usual place.

Here are some of the bugfixes we made:

-  Importing and exporting of songs database.
-  Corrected various issues in theme management, including previews and
   vertical align.
-  Ability to hide the display screen completely, enabling other
   applications to display on the second screen.
-  If you edit a song, the song remains selected, and the list doesn't
   scroll out of view (partially fixed).
-  Added an option to select whether or not you want to be prompted
   every time you load openlp.org and the screen is blanked.
-  Bible formats changed and Bible CSV Importer Wizard improved.
-  Show/hide options for the media manager, order of service, and theme
   manager.
-  Various other song, Bible, etc. display fixes.
