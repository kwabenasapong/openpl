|Survey|

**Update:** The survey has been closed. We received 381 responses, and
are busy processing the responses.

Before I kick off the main gist of this post, I'd just like to announce that OpenLP 2.0.3
has finally made it to our `Ubuntu PPA <http://launchpad.net/~openlp-core/+archive/release>`_.

Unfortunately I was having computer hardware issues and I wasn't able
to get the build process set up until a few days ago. I've remedied this
problem by setting up the build process on our Continuous Integration
server such that anyone can build packages for the PPA by simply
clicking a button.

As per the title of this post, we have set up a
`survey <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tGoW26DU-zwIkyyNHFNm_f9a9zgsZH3YrwfGwFIkZN8/viewform>`_
to help us decide on what the most important features are that we need
to work on. This survey is completely anonymous, but we do ask that you
only fill it out once. We've also set maximum number of features to
choose so that we are absolutely certain that these are the most
important features. Have your say: `complete the
survey <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tGoW26DU-zwIkyyNHFNm_f9a9zgsZH3YrwfGwFIkZN8/viewform>`_.
