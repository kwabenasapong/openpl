|OpenLP for Android|

Following hot on the heels of the 1.9.10 release the next version of the
Android client has escaped.

This client version works best with 1.9.10 but will also work (with
restricted functionality) with other versions.

The new features added since 0.4 are:

-  Changes to the panels to allow them to be swiped left and right
   instead of only being accessed via the menu. This should improve Â the
   usability of the application.
-  Provide the ability to poll the main application for updates. This
   will allow two users to work together. In the settings there is a
   "Refresh Displays" setting which allows the refresh time to be set.
   The default is 5 seconds and a refresh time of 0 seconds turns this
   feature off.
-  Following requests from a number of users it is now possible to have
   Server profiles for different locations. These are accessed again via
   the settings panel.
-  To aid usability, the displayed verse is now highlighted on the live
   tab so it is obvious which slide is selected.
