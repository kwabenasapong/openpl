Yep, we've released RC3. This includes a (hopefully) fixed PowerPoint
bug. Neither Derek nor I are getting it anymore, so we figure it's
fixed.

Derek also rewrote the bible verse selection section, and added the
ability to add more than 1 verse to a slide... just select 2 or 3 verses
and click on the "Add to order of service" button, and it'll appear on 1
slide. Also, if you look in the options window, you'll see that there's
a "Verse slide layout" section where you can choose whether you want all
the verses displayed together or each on a separate line on the slide.

So, a couple of new things in this release, a couple of things fixed.
If you encounter any bugs, use the bug reporting topic in the forums to
file your bug report.
