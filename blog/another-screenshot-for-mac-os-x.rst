I feel really sorry for our testers who use Mac OS X, because they have
to go through a real mission to get OpenLP 2.0 up and running on their
machines. One of our testers who uses Mac OS X was brave enough to
undertake that massive task, and sent in the screenshot below to prove
to us that it ***is*** possible. Well done Andreas!
