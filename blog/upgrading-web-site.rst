Some folks might have noticed that the formats of some of our URLs have
changed. Over the course of the next few weeks we'll be making various
tweaks and changes to the site in preparation for upgrading the backend
of the site.

Most of your interactions will remain the same, but some of your old
links might not resolve. If you do hit a "page not found" error, simply
navigate back to the home page of the site, and see if you can find what
you were looking for from there. If that doesn't work, please either
drop us an e-mail, or pop into our IRC channel and leave us a note with
the URL you were trying to access, and we'll take it from there.
