One of our users, Jonathan Corwin, has written a couple of little
scripts to do various imports for openlp.org. One of the most requested
items are Bible translations, and Jonathan has written a script that can
import Bibles from BibleGateway.com, which should be legal in terms of
the "fair use" clause of copyright law. Please note, however, that I am
not a lawyer, so I might be totally incorrect about this.

We've listed Jonathan's software on a new page in the documentation:
Useful Utilities. If you have written a utility for openlp.org and what
it included on this page, please let me know (see the Contributing
page).
