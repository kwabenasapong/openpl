OpenLP 2.0 is moving along nicely at this stage, and we're probably not
too far off an initial unstable release, but before we get there we are
in need of one thing in particular: people with Macs.

Currently most of our developers are using Linux, and we have plenty
access to Windows XP, Vista and 7, but we don't have anyone at a
developer level on Mac OS X. The only problem with this is that we can't
test out OpenLP on Mac OS X, nor can we package it for Mac OS X.

If you have a Mac and you have some development experience, and are
willing to help us out with getting OpenLP up and running and packaging
it for Mac OS X, please get into contact with us, either through the IRC
channel or by private messaging me on the site.
