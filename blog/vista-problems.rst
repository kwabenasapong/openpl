A couple of guys using Vista have told us that the problem is that
openlp.org is looking for a file that doesn't exist in DirectX 10
anymore (openlp.org uses DirectX 9 headers). You need to download and
install D3DRM.dll. You should be able to simply copy the file into the
openlp.org directory (on most systems it should be "C:\\Program
Files\\openlp.org") and openlp.org should work fine. Let me know about
this, I'm operating on hearsay.

| On the other hand, I've moved to Linux full time now, Kubuntu 7.04
(Feisty Fawn), as my main desktop, although I'll still have a Windows
box around to develop openlp.org.Â  If you haven't looked at Linux yet, I
would strongly recommend you do! Download a CD image from www.ubuntu.com
and try it out!
