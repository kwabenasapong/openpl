For the next release due at the end of the month a "First Time Wizard"
has been developed to help set up a new environment.

This will allow a user to:

-  Choose which plugins they want activated
-  Download Songs, Bibles and Themes from the web
-  Set up the Initial display screen and the default theme.

As a number of users already have a working setup they will still need
to run this wizard. Â In most cases this will allow them to add
additional bibles and themes BUT it may change their plugin settings and
if they choose to download the songs it ***will overwrite their current
songs database***.

The default option is not to download any Songs, Bibles or Themes.

This Wizard has be added to the code base.
