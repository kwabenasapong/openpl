Hi folks,

Good news for those experiencing the latest two bugs, I've fixed them
and I'm releasing openlp.org 1.0.3.

This release fixes a problem some folks were having where openlp.org
would forget which monitor had been setup for the projector, and in some
cases would throw a "List index out of bounds" error. It also fixes a
bug where some folks would see a number of "openlp.org" folders in the
recycle bin.

You can get all the 1.0.3-goodness from the download page.
