OpenLP is now available in the Arch User Repository (AUR). If you are an
Arch user I'm sure you are familiar with the AUR, but just in case check
out the wiki on the AUR. If you are using Yaourt to install from the AUR
a simple 'yaourt -S openlp' will install OpenLP 1.9.3 (Alpha 3). I have
used OpenLP some on Arch Linux and I am extremely impressed even using a
fairly heavey desktop like KDE, Arch and OpenLP fly.

We would like to think "floft" for making this happen for OpenLP. floft,
we would love for you to contact us so we could give you more formal
recognition for this great contribution to the OpenLP community.
