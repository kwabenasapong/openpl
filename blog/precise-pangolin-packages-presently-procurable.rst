Last night I added Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin to our PPA, so from
today or tomorrow all those early birds who like to run Ubuntu from the
first alpha release should be able to download the daily build of OpenLP
for 12.04. Unfortunately, OpenLP 1.9.7 will be not available for 12.04,
but 1.9.8 and up will be.

Don't forget, we support all flavours of Ubuntu, including Kubuntu,
Xubuntu and Lubuntu. Mint Linux is also supported, as long as you are
using the standard edition, not the Debian edition (the Debian edition
should work too, but it doesn't work directly from the PPA). We also
support all releases from 10.04 and up, so don't worry if you want to
stick to the LTS releases of Ubuntu, we still support you!

To download OpenLP 1.9.7 for Ubuntu 10.04 to 11.10, go to our download
page and add the PPA to your software sources. To download a nightly
build (testers and adventurous users only!) of OpenLP, go to the
download page and scroll down to the *Developer Downloads* section.
