It is time once again for an OpenLP head count. 1,000 Facebook fans is a
huge sign of the people who use and support OpenLP. While, of course, we
arenâ€™t exactly getting scientific here, it is great to know that OpenLP
is helping out churches literally all across the world.

The OpenLP Beta 2 release has been out for a while now is working very
well . I know it has been working very well for our church. Further
improvements are scheduled for the next beta release that will be out
soon. As always your input is need, in bug reports, testing, and
spreading the word about OpenLP.

We can also especially use the help of Mac users. The developers and
testers for the most part do not have a great deal of access to Mac
hardware. If you are a Mac user and have time your help would be greatly
appreciated. The hope is that OpenLP will be running on OS X Lion on the
release after the upcoming release (1.9.8). Currently OpenLP does not
run on Lion due to known issues.

Another thing to look forward to in coming releases is improved
multimedia support. I know this has been an issue for many users, me
included. Don't fear help is on the way. It may be a few months before
this is completely resolved but there is a huge effort to get media
support working properly in OpenLP on all platforms for all users.

We are extremly grateful for all those users of OpenLP that have left a
message of thanks and support. I know this is a great uplift to the
developers who are tirelessly working on this project in their spare
time. Also, if you need support there are several options for you. You
can always drop an email to support at openlp.org, or chat at #openlp on
freenode, and you can use the convenient web chat. We are also still
working on documentation for version to so be sure to check it out also.

The community at OpenLP is always growing. If you would like to get
involved in developing, testing, documentation. or support, come join in
today and help us make OpenLP even better.
