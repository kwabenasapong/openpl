Hi folks,

Yes, it's that age-old call for help that you can hear reverberating
through the openlp.org hills again...

We have reached the stage in the development of version 2.0 where we
need to start testing. We have a lead tester, but we need some extra
folks to help with the testing.

We need folks running Windows (2K/XP/Vista/7), Linux (any distro that
runs Qt4 and Python 2.5 or up), and Mac OS X (Tiger and up). You don't
need any experience in software testing, you just need to be committed
to installing some software libraries on your computer and spending some
time running through and testing version 2.0.

If you're interested in helping out, please send a private message to
either myself or Wesley (wstout) with the subject, "Help Offered:
Tester", and the following information:

-  Your name
-  Your e-mail address
-  Your openlp.org username
-  Your operating system (eg. "Linux: Fedora Core 10" or "Mac OS X:
   Leopard")
-  Your location (eg. "Atlanta GA, USA" or "Pilsen, Czech Republic")
-  Your timezone (eg. "GMT-4/-5" or "GMT+1/+2") (please note that I
   don't live in the States, so "Eastern Standard Time" means nothing to
   me)
