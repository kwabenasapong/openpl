So, yesterday evening I decided to try to see how wxMac would compile
openlp. It took all night to install wxMac, but finally this morning
I've got openlp to compile, and present to you the first screenshots of
openlp on a Mac! Bear in mind that there are a lot of crinkles to iron
out now, but I'm pretty impressed by the fact it ported easily to the
Mac, and that hopefully, we can get it workable for the same release as
openlp.org on Windows cross platform.

Let me know what you think, please!
