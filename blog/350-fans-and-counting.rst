OpenLP has hit yet another milestone, 350 Facebook Fans. While not
scientific, it appears that OpenLP's popularity is ever increasing as
the developers continue chugging along with version 2. There are
constant improvements being made, feature request being filled, and I
think the developers even find time to sleep and have a life on
occasion.

Â 

As you can see OpenLP 2 is running very nicely on Ubuntu.

Please be advised that version 2.0 is still in the alpha stage. It will
likely crash and do strange things without warning, so we can use all
the testers that have the time to try things out. If you are interested
in trying out OpenLP 2.0 check out the FAQ . It would not be advised to
depend on version 2.0 for your every day needs just yet.

Please try OpenLP 2.0 out and help us make it the best release possible.
Also, feel free to join us in chat anytime.
