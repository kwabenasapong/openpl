Well, we're getting ready to release openlp.org 1.0.1 - the bugfix.
Derek and I have had a lot of work on our plates recently, and haven't
been able to devote the amount of time to openlp.org that we'd like to.
However, after we both managed to clear up some time on our plates,
we've fixed all the bugs on our list.

We'd like to include some themes and as many translations as possible in
this release, so if you're keen on seeing your work in a release, now's
the time to get busy! We already have a completed Spanish language file,
and some themes, but we'd like more languages, and a wider variety of
themes.

Thanks for your patience so far!
