In the last few weeks a number of requested features have been added to
the 2.x code base.

-  Transitions where a song slide will fade into the next slide
   automatically. This option still needs to be made configurable as it
   is expected some people will not wish to use it or find it
   distracting.
-  | Verse tagging where each slide is given a tag  eg Verse, Chorus, 
   Bridge , Intro.
   | Verses will also be given a number as there can be many of them in
   a song!
   | It will then be possible to simply change the order of the verses,
   if required.  One advantage of this is that each slide is only stored
   once but can be used may times>
   | For Example a ***verse list*** could look like:

       V1 V2 C V3 C B V4 C V1

   A Verse (V1) can be one or many slides, all tagged the same and
   treated as a block.
