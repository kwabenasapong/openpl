If you'd like to keep track of the development of openlp.org, see where
we are and what we're up to, you can go to our project management tool
at http://project.openlp.org/. Login with the username/password
combination of guest/guest and you'll be able to see the task lists and
milestones and things we have set for ourselves.

Just remember though when it comes to the dates of milestones, it
doesn't mean we will actually stick to those dates we put in there, they
are just a guideline for us, a goal to attempt to achieve. We all work
and have families, and so we try to fit openlp.org in where we can.
