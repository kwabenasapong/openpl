If you'd like to see OpenLP in your language, now's the time! We are about 2 weeks away from the release of 2.2, and
now is your opportunity to translate OpenLP's interface into your own language.

In order for your langauge to be included you need to have completed the `translation of OpenLP 2.2`_ (you'll need to be
logged into `Transifex`_ to see this page) **by midnight UTC (GMT) on Saturday the 10th of October 2015**.

Because we believe strongly in quality over quantity at OpenLP, we will not be including any translations that are
incomplete into the final build. **This means that if you want your language to be part of the final release of version
2.2, you need to make sure it is 100% done by the end of Saturday the 10th of October**. This deadline also gives you
just over a week to complete any outstanding translations.

Languages Needing Work
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently, the following translations are more than 80% complete, but still need some work (ordered from most complete
to least complete). My estimate is that none of these should take longer than about 2 hours to complete.

*  Polish
*  French
*  Lithuanian
*  Russian
*  Portuguese (Brazil)
*  Bulgarian

The following translations are between 40% and 80% complete. Unless these are worked on this week, they probably won't
make it into the final release of OpenLP.

*  Thai (Thailand)
*  Tamil (Sri-Lanka)
*  Greek
*  Afrikaans
*  Chinese (China)
*  Korean

Lastly, the following translations are less than 40% complete. If any of these translations makes it into the final
release, I will be very surprised.

*  Slovenian
*  Italian
*  Macedonian
*  Ukrainian
*  Norweigian Nyorsk
*  Papiamento
*  Turkish
*  Malayalam
*  Latvian
*  Spanish (Colombia)
*  Arabic
*  Albanian
*  Korean (Korea)
*  Ukranian (Ukraine)
*  Khmer (Cambodia)
*  Russian (Russia)
*  Amharic
*  English (United States)
*  Klingon
*  Arabic (Egypt)
*  Spanish (Chile)
*  Vietnamese (Viet Nam)
*  Vietnamese
