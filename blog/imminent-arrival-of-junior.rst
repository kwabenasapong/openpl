No, we're not releasing OpenLP 2.0, my wife and I are expecting a baby.

From time to time in the past I have blogged things of a more personal
nature, which I know some of the OpenLP community have welcomed, and I
figured that most of the community would like to hear this bit of news.

My wife is booked for a caesarean section on Wednesday, 29th July. This
is our first child, and we're both excited, but also daunted at the
responsibility we have been given to take care of this baby. We would
most certainly appreciate your prayers for the operation and for the
adjustments we have to make and for the additional financial
consequences of a child.

Of course, having a new born baby is unfortunately also going to impact
the amount of work I can do on OpenLP, but I'm hoping that it won't be
taking away too much of my time.

Thanks for your prayers and support!
