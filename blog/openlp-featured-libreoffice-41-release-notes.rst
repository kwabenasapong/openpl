|LibreOffice Impress|

As some of our users will have noted, `LibreOffice 4.1 was
released <https://www.libreoffice.org/download/4-1-new-features-and-fixes>`_
on the 25th of July. Included in this release are a whole lot of bug
fixes and improvements, but one that stands out is an option that was
added to Impress to aid in integration with OpenLP.

As of LibreOffice 4.0, the presenter console extension became part of
the core of LibreOffice, and OpenLP was not able to turn this off. Tim,
one of our core developers, `submitted a
bug <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56995>`_ to the
LibreOffice bug tracker, and an Indian student named Manik Malhotra
picked it up for part of his Google Summer of Code submission to
LibreOffice. Many thanks to Tim for his ongoing push to make folks aware
of the bug, and to Manik for writing the fix!

As a result of being mentioned in the release notes, our website had a
little bump in the amount of traffic it received on Thursday, Friday and
Monday. Sundays are usually our busiest days (I wonder why?) but this
past week it was Thursday, followed by Friday, followed by Monday. All
three of those days beat the usual Sunday traffic.

Never heard of `LibreOffice <https://www.libreoffice.org/>`_?
LibreOffice is an open source office suite, a free alternative to
Microsoft Office. LibreOffice runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, and
can read and write most MS Office files. OpenLP supports displaying
presentations using LibreOffice on Windows and Linux (OS X is
unfortunately currently not supported).
