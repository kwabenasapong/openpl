Hello folks,

Time for a new feature, time for a new blog post...

I just added special shortcut support to the Live Controller to OpenLP.
This allows you to navigate through and jump between your slides in the
Live Controller using only your keyboard. This works for any type of
slide, e. g. songs, bible verses and images.

How does it work?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to jump to verse 3 using the keyboard, press "v" and within
a time frame of 350ms, press "3". (It is technically not possible to
have the shortcut v + 3.) If you are concerned that 350ms is too short,
consider that you normally have to press all keys at the same time when
using “real” shortcuts (like "CTRL + C"), so as long as you are quick
enough, you will be successful!

Available Shortcuts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| Verse:                               | Chorus:                              |
| V                                    | C                                    |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

Once you have pressed the slide type, you can use the numbers from 0-9.

People using a translated version of OpenLP can change the shortcuts if
they want to (the numbers are not configurable) via `Settings →
Configure
Shortcuts <http://manual.openlp.org/configure_shortcuts.html>`__...

God bless, OpenLP Team
