The milestones for OpenLP keep on coming. Today we reached 200 Facebook
fans! Excitement is building for the release of version 2.0, and version
1 has been receiving some nice improvements over the last few months.
There have also been some comments about users leaving high priced
software and coming to OpenLP. With the economic situation today more
and more churches are turning to OpenLP because of cost. After turning
to OpenLP many are being pleasantly surprised at how well it competes
and in many cases performs better than its high priced alternatives.
With the buzz ever increasing we look forward to the next 100 fans and
enabling more churches to enhance their worship and their ministries.

If you're not already a fan, why don't you head over to ourFacebook Page
and become a fan! Don't forget to follow OpenLP on Twitter, and add the
RSS feed to your aggregator! We also have a group on Facebook, and a
group on LinkedIn.
