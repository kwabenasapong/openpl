Hi guys,

Congratulations to Raoul and his team on the release of openlp.org beta
4. It's looking great! I have been very busy outside of programming,
just being back from tour in the US with my band Glass Darkly. We played
14 times over 14 days, and had a great time with it all!

I'm currently thinking up some new ideas for Christian open source
projects that might interest me, and would be interested in hearing of
any ideas that people have for software that has a church use, and has
no or little open source alternative to a mainstream rival.  You can
email me at tim [AT] this domain.

 Cheers guys,

Tim
