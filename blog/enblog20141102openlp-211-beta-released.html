This new version,two years in the making, is packed full of new features, bug fixes, and improvements.</p><p>We realise that this may not contain all the new features that people are looking for, but we're hoping to speed up the number of releases we make to around two releases per year. We're hoping in this way to be able to include more bugfixes and have a faster and more reliable release schedule. This way you don't have to wait 4 years for every new release, but there will be fewer new features per release in order to achieve this.</p><p></p><h3><strong>Important Notes</strong></h3><p>OpenLP 2.1.1 is <strong>not backwards compatible</strong> with 2.0.5. Once you have upgraded from 2.0.5, version 2.0.5 cannot read the upgraded files. OpenLP 2.1.1 will make a backup on startup, but it is recommended that you make your own backup too.</p><p>Upgrading from versions of OpenLP before 2.0.5 are not supported. You need to upgrade to 2.0.5 first, and make sure you run OpenLP at least once before continuing to upgrade to 2.1.1</p><p>This is a beta release, which means it is not yet finished and likely to still contain a few bugs. Please test it out as much as you can (using a Portable build on Windows is a good way to do this) and report the bugs you find.</p><p>Service Files created in 2.1.1 cannot be opened in 2.0</p><h3><strong>System Requirements</strong></h3><p>OpenLP's system requrements have been upgraded since the 2.0.5 release.
