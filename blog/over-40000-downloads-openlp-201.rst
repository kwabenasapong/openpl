Tracking usage of OpenLP is incredibly difficult. Because it is an open
source project, there are no registrations to check, you don't know how
many times OpenLP has been copied and given to other people. So we don't
ever have a true idea of how many churches are using OpenLP.

Tracking downloads is also quite difficult due to OpenLP being available
in a number of distribution channels. We know roughly how many downloads
there are of the Windows and OS X versions because most folks just
download them from our SourceForge.net mirrors. There are a couple of
BitTorrent downloads, which we cannot track, but it is such a small
download that most folks just do a direct download.

Tracking downloads for the various Linux distributions is far tricker,
as there are no download statistics available. We cannot retrieve any
number from FreeBSD, Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian or Arch. Having said that,
we do have a PPA (Personal Package Archive) on Launchpad.net for our
Ubuntu users, and we are able to track those downloads.

So, using the data we **do** have available to us, we can surmise that
as of the time of posting, OpenLP 2.0.1 has been downloaded **43,781**
times. That's over *forty thousand* times! The real figure is probably a
lot higher, thanks to the downloads we can't track, but this still gives
us a rough idea of the impact of OpenLP.

If you haven't downloaded OpenLP yet, `DO IT
