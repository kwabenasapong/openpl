We're very close to releasing OpenLP 2.2 now. We've made a few
additional bug fixes and have decided to release another Release
Candidate. If we don't find any major bugs in this version, the next
release will be 2.2.

These are the bugs we fixed in this release:

-  #1473632: crash on every file dialog
-  #1420356: sending presentation live with libreoffice initially is
   minimized to taskbar
-  #1463703: When diplaying a presentation from a loaded service the
   slidecontroller is blank
-  #1465390: Traceback when going from blanked presentation to video
-  #1201293: Unexpected Power Point dialogues triggers exception
-  #1464421: Connection errors in SongSelect are not handled
-  #1450596: Failure to verify SSL cert in SongSelect importer

I'd like to say a special thank you to Tomas G who has been fixing bugs
and pushing this release, and to Jonathan S for doing a lot of work on
PyInstaller and OpenLP to make OpenLP sail on Mac OS X.

A Windows build will be uploaded during the course of the week.

    | For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven:
    |     a time to be born, and a time to die;
    | a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;
    |     a time to kill, and a time to heal;
    | a time to break down, and a time to build up;
    |     a time to weep, and a time to laugh;
    | a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
    |     a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;
    | a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
    |     a time to seek, and a time to lose;
    | a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
    |     a time to tear, and a time to sew;
    | a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
    |     a time to love, and a time to hate;
    | a time for war, and a time for peace.

    Ecclesiastes 3:1-8

With my grandmother's passing recently, and reading the Bible to my kids
at night, these verses have been coming up a lot recently. I think it is
important for us to always be aware of the timeousness of what we're
doing. Make the best use of your time here on earth, so that you can
reap the rewards of your eathly work in Heaven.
