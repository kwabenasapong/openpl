The new Theme Manager is now taking shape and I have been able to
generate some sample layouts.

There are a number of changes being introduced in the new versions.  The
most significant is that themes will need to be exported from version 1
and imported into version 2 due to internal changes in the storage
mechanism.  The import will correct the structure and add defaults where
appropriate.

Other changes include:

-  Real Font sizes not percentages on the screen.
-  Ability to set the font size and color for footers
-  Background rendering for circles.

Two examples are below.
