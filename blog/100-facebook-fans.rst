OpenLP has hit another milestone with 100 Facebook fans! This is yet
another sign of OpenLP's growing popularity. 2009 has been a great year
for OpenLP. Version 1 has seen updates and is better than ever and
version 2 is coming along nicely with many of the frequently requested
new features and an overall improved look and feel. As more and more
churches move to using media to enhance their worship experiences it
only stands to reason that the popularity of OpenLP will continue to
increase. What will 2010 bring to OpenLP world? A release of 2.0? 200
fans on Facebook? 500? perhaps even 1,000 Facebook fans? Whatever
happens it is great to see that OpenLP is gaining in popularity and also
helping Christians all over the world worship Him more effectively.
