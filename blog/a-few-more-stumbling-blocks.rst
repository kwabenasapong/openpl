Howdy folks...

We've found a few more bugs, so we haven't released yet. That said and
done, I think that we will release in this week, even if there are still
known bugs, just to get the release out there.

Also, I didn't have the time I thought I would have, since my fianc√©e
arrived on Thursday and so I was otherwise occupied. So yes, as if to
confirm what I already knew, a woman can take up a lot of a man's time -
not that I'm complaining!
