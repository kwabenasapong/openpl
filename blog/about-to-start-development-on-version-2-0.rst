hi all,

with 1.0 nearly out, i want to start assembling a team for development
on version 2.0.

version 2.0 is going to have a lot of features, hopefully most, if not
all, of the requested features. it's gonna require a lot of work, and i
need a team of dedicated people who would like to help out.

we need people good in the following areas:

-  user interface design
-  database programming
-  graphics programming
-  powerpoint and openoffice.org integration
-  plugin design and development
-  web development in php
-  the ever popular documentation

if you have any skills you'd like to offer, please don't hesitate to
contact me at *raoul[at]openlp.org*.
