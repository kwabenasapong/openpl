I'm back from honeymoon, and feeling relaxed and refreshed. I was
pleased to see all the bug reports and related requests when I got back.
Thanks to you folks, openlp.org is being put through it's paces and
refined into an almost bug-free piece of software.

So I just wanted to say thanks to all those folks who have been
rigorously testing openlp.org to see that it meets their requirements
and operates without problems. Without you folks we wouldn't be able to
put out such a fine piece of software (if I might say so myself).

Please continue to test openlp.org, and send us bug reports (if we don't
have them already), Derek and I would like to kill as many bugs as
possible in RC5, probably have an RC6 to make sure we have no more bugs
left, and then release the final version.
