Hi folks!

openlp.org is once again looking for volunteers to help out!

We are looking for a couple of people to join our support team. You must
know openlp.org quite well, regard yourself a power user, and be able to
troubleshoot problems with Windows and Office.

If you'd like to help out, please contact David, the head of support, at
support[at]openlp.org.
