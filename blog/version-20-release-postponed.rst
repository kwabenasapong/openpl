|OpenLP version 2.0|

As many of our users know, we've been aiming to make the final release
of OpenLP 2.0 this coming weekend. After much thought and consideration,
we have decided to postpone the release till the end of November.

When releasing software there comes a point where you need to decide
whether or not it is good enough to be released. With OpenLP we had a
look at the number of major, minor and trivial bugs outstanding and made
the decision that it is not quite good enough for a final release. We
would rather release OpenLP when we are happy with the quality of the
software than with a bunch of glaring bugs we could have fixed if we
waited just a little bit longer.

Don't forget that this gives everyone an extra couple of weeks to
`translate
OpenLP <http://openlp.org/en/blog/2012/10/12/lets-get-translating>`_,
`find more
bugs <http://openlp.org/en/blog/2012/09/24/gearing-final-release>`_, or
just `promote it in your Church
circles <http://openlp.org/en/blog/2012/10/07/media-kit-now-available>`_.

See you at the end of November!

**Update:** After some discussion the development team has decided to
release OpenLP 2.0 on the 1\ :sup:`st` of December 2012.
