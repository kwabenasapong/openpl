Unfortunately it seems that the 2.0 release of OpenLP didn't go quite as
smoothly as planned, and a few bugs crept into the release just a few
days before the deadline. Fortunately we've been able to track these
bugs down and fix them.

The bugs we've fixed are:

-  Song export and import now works correctly
-  Transparent themes are once again transparent
-  PowerPoint/lmpress files with unicode characters in the filename can
   be imported
-  OpenLP is now more usable with the XFCE desktop on Linux

Please note that it will still be necessary to use an older version of
VLC on OS X (2.0.3) as more recent versions are still troublesome (2.0.4
and 2.0.5) and we are attempting to rectify the problem.

We hope that despite the name, this version is less buggy than the
previous one and that you can use it with confidence during your acts of
worship.

As usual, you can grab this release from the `download
page <http://openlp.org/download>`__. The torrents, portable versions
and various Linux packages will be updated over the next week or so.
