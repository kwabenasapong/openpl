Well, it's 2 days before the release of openlp.org 1.0, and I am proud
to say that we have almost all the issues resolved. It was a bit
touch-and-go earlier, with a few of the bugs being potential
show-stoppers, and with solutions seeming to be unavailable, but
fortunately we have managed to either fix them or work around them.

The one thing that unfortunately is NOT complete is the user guide,
otherwise known as the documentation. We'll be releasing with what we
have so far, and after the release, we'll work on the documentation, and
release 1.0.1 with the complete documentation. There is enough in the
documentation for the user to be able to get to know how to use
openlp.org, so it's not a big deal.

For those who don't know, Hannah and I have also been moving these last
two weeks, so things have been really hectic. I'm really grateful to
Derek and Jonathan Corwin for stepping in and taking up any extra slack
when I've not been able to get work done on openlp.org.

Derek and I have also been investigating getting CDs printed. This is a
slightly expensive affair, as you no doubt can imagine, but if there is
enough interest, we'd like to pursue that option. I'm thinking of doing
something similar to Ubuntu's Shipit, except that we don't have the
millions that Mark Shuttleworth has, so we'd be asking you to pay for CD
production and shipping costs. Of course, buying in bulk reduces the
cost of the CDs, and in a minor way, the cost of the shipping too.

And lastly, don't forget to subscribe to the openlp.org newsletter! This
is where we'll announce new releases and important events. Don't worry,
we won't spam you, and you won't get lots of mail.Â
