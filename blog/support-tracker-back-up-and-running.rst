I've just finished setting up a new support tracker so that those folks
who want to send e-mails to "support (at) openlp.org" can do so.
Unfortunately I noticed as I was setting it up, that people have been
sending mail to that address, but due to our old support tracking
software falling over, we didn't see those e-mails. Hopefully now this
should be fixed.

Please remember, however, that the fastest and easiest way to get
support is via the Live IRC Chat page.
