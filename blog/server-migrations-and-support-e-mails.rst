If anyone has had problems e-mailing either our support e-mail address
or our bug reporting e-mail address over the last couple of weeks, we
apologise for the inconvenience.

A few weeks ago we migrated some of our systems, including our web site,
e-mail server and support system, to an new server for better
performance and security. As smooth as the transition was, it wasn't
100% without error, and one of the small problems that we only
discovered in the last 2 days was that some of our e-mails were not
getting through to our new support system.

If you sent an e-mail in the last 3 or 4 weeks, and you never heard a
reply from us (apart from an automated reply, perhaps), then please
e-mail us again and we should now get your e-mails and be able to
respond to your queries. If we still don't seem to be getting your
e-mails, please visit us in
`IRC <http://openlp.org/support/live-chat-irc>`__ and let us know which
e-mail address you sent your query to, and when you sent it.

Thanks for your patience, and your continued support!
