Ladies and gentlemen, we are proud to present to you our first beta release of OpenLP 2.2. This new version,two years in
the making, is packed full of new features, bug fixes, and improvements.

We realise that this may not contain all the new features that people are looking for, but we're hoping to speed up the
number of releases we make to around two releases per year. We're hoping in this way to be able to include more bugfixes
and have a faster and more reliable release schedule. This way you don't have to wait 4 years for every new release, but
there will be fewer new features per release in order to achieve this.

Important Notes
---------------

OpenLP 2.1.1 is **not backwards compatible** with 2.0.5. Once you have upgraded from 2.0.5, version 2.0.5 cannot read
the upgraded files. OpenLP 2.1.1 will make a backup on startup, but it is recommended that you make your own backup too.

Upgrading from versions of OpenLP before 2.0.5 are not supported. You need to upgrade to 2.0.5 first, and make sure you
run OpenLP at least once before continuing to upgrade to 2.1.1

This is a beta release, which means it is not yet finished and likely to still contain a few bugs. Please test it out as
much as you can (using a Portable build on Windows is a good way to do this) and report the bugs you find.

Service Files created in 2.1.1 cannot be opened in 2.0

System Requirements
-------------------

OpenLP's system requrements have been upgraded since the 2.0.5 release. Please take note:

* Windows Vista and up
* Mac OS X 10.8 and 10.9
* Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10
