Over the last few years since we started accepting donations we're received a couple of enquiries from people looking
to be able to donate via credit card or Bitcoin, and without needing a PayPal account. We're pleased to announce that
you can now donate to OpenLP in Bitcoin or with a debit or credit card.

Just head on over to the `donate`_ page which now has options for Bitcoin and debit/credit card too. Debit/credit card
payments are powered by `Stripe`_.  As always, if you run into any issues please `let us know`_.

In other news, we've recently updated OpenLP in Debian Linux. For a while we were unable to update the package because
of preparation for the Debian 9 release. Now that Debian 9 has been released, we're able to update the OpenLP package
again. OpenLP should come through with your regular updates.
