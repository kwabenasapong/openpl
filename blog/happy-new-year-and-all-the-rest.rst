Howdy folks!

Happy new year to you all from me and the team at openlp.org. We hope
that 2007 is indeed a blessed year and you and your churches grow closer
to God.

From our side, we're still working hard on openlp.org beta 5. We're
hoping to get that out the door middle to end of this month.

As usual, we can always do with more people, so if you think you can be
of use and you'd like to help out, you can contact us through the
contact page.

| Well, God bless to you all!
