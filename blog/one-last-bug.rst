Well, according to our bug list, we have one last bug to fix. And in the
traditional style of bugs, it's proving to be the most elusive. Derek
and I are both working on it, so we're hoping to have it solved pretty
soon.

One thing to take note of is that the XML format for the themes has
changed slightly. Fortunately this is not a big problem, and will cause
at most a minor inconvenience. The simple way to "upgrade" your themes
from the older to the newer format is to edit them and save them with
their original settings.

These last few changes will be the last ones for openlp.org 1.0. After
RC6 we will clean up any additional bugs in openlp.org, and then release
the final version.

We're hoping to have RC out in the next week or so, and then 1.0 final
by the end of January. It's a little later than Derek or I expected, but
then again, we didn't expect our day-job workloads to be that much
either...
