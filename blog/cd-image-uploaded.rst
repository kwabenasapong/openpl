After a pretty dismal and disappointing poll vote on pressing and
mailing a CD, I've decided to stick with what the "masses" want, and not
produce the CD. That said and done, I had already created the ISO
(image) and one or two folks suggested putting the image file up so that
folks can download it and burn it to CD.

So here it is. It includes some other open source and free software as
well, so download and enjoy.

You can download it from the download page, as usual.
