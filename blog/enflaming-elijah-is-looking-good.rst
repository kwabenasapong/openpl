Hi folks,

I just wanted to drop an update about our next release, OpenLP 1.9.6
"Enflaming Elijah". We've been working hard on getting a lot of things
fixed and improved in this release, including various aspects of
internationalisation (especially around Bibles), media support, speed
and general stability. I'm really pleased with our progress thus far,
and am looking forward to the release at the end of this month.

So far we are on track to release 1.9.6 on the 26th of June, as per our
proposed milestones.

Some key features/enhancements in the upcoming version:

-  Faster startup times on Windows
-  Translation of everything (hopefully!), including all menu items,
   buttons on wizards and dialogs, and even the web remote.
-  Improved language support for Bibles

Thanks to everyone who has helped us so far.
