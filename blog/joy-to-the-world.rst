Nothing sums up Christmas like the following song:

| Joy to the world, the Lord is come!
|  Let earth receive her King.
|  Let every heart prepare Him room
|  And Heaven and nature sing.

I pray that you and your families would all have a very blessed and
Christ filled Christmas. May we never forget the reason why Christ was
born to us, and His gift of Grace.

Yours in Christ,

Derek.
