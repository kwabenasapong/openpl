|OpenLP v1 in use|

In just over a weeks time, the OpenLP `facebook
page <http://facebook.com/openlp>`__ will be switched over to the new
Timeline view. The new view gives us the opportunity to add a cover
image to go along the top of the page, and this is where we would like
your help...

Ideally we would like to use a picture of OpenLP being used, with a full
worshipping congregation and both the operators screen and the projector
screen in view. For example a long time ago when v1 was just being born
and monitors were still the size of a small car, the photo on the right
was taken. We would like to bring it up to date..

As always, there are a few restrictions. This makes it significantly
harder, but we might accept an image close to the mark:

#. We would like to see a view of a recent v2 version, with close to the
   default layout.
#. Any lyrics on the screen ideally in the Public Domain, if possible.
   Although Scripture will be fine too. English would be preferable.
#. A fairly full looking congregation, who don't look like they are
   bored ;)
#. The trickiest bit.. the image has to be an unstretched 851x315
   resolution.
#. In focus ;) and not too dark.
#. Note that facebook displays the OpenLP logo over part of the bottom
   left of the image
#. Oh and full permission for OpenLP to use the picture, although you'll
   retain the copyright.

Also if you have other ideas for a type of image we could use, then
please share them in the comments too.

You can post images to our facebook wall or use an image sharing site
such as `imgur <http://imgur.com>`__ and post the links below.

*Disclaimer: We don't guarantee we'll use your photo as the cover even
if it the only one created and has a 1000 likes. Therefore we don't
recommend you spend 3 solid days setting up the perfect shot, and going
out to buy the latest Canon or Nikon DSLR just to take this picture!
Raoul has the final word.*

We look forward to seeing your photos :)
