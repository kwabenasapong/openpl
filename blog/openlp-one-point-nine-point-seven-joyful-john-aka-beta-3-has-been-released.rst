    OpenLP one point nine point seven
    It's like a match made in heaven,
    With plenty new features
    And fewer bug creatures.

*(Stupid poem courtesy of Raoul - you can moan at him!)*

**NB**: Please note that OpenLP does not work on OS X 10.7 Lion. This is
a known issue, and we are working on a solution.

It's release time again, and once again this new version will not
disappoint. Along with over 79 bug fixes there have been a large number
of features added.

Moving on we hope the next release will either be the first Release
Candidate, or the last beta.

New features:

-  Basic support for audio files on songs.
-  Internal database upgrading (no more re-importing of your database).
-  Drag and Drop support has been enhanced from the desktop into all
   plugins and Services.
-  It is now possible to change to the colour surrounding small images
   used for themes or when displayed from a service.
-  The Song database now records when a song is created and edited.
-  Song Usage can now record when a song is used or printed.
-  The Android client is now available on the Android Market
-  More visible indication if song usage is active or not.
-  Tooltips in the service manager, including theme name, notes and
   media playing time.
-  The spell checker is active in notes as well.
-  The First Run Wizard can be re-run.
-  Settings can be exported and imported.

Major bugs that have been fixed:

-  Render performance improvements.
-  Image displaying performance improvement.
-  Fixed JPEG support on Mac OS X 10.6.
-  Formatting tags now work on second slide when slide is split.
-  You can update the song's theme by double-clicking on the top level
   item in the service manager after setting a new theme.
-  The manual is now packaged with OpenLP on Windows.
-  Various fixes around the First Run Wizard, including better handling
   of no connectivity.
-  Various fixes for the Bible and songs imports.
