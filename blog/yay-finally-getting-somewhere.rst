howdy folks,

apologies to all for the silence, things have been rather hectic here in
cape town, we've been having trouble with electricty, meaning that i'm 2
weeks behind at work, never mind with stuff at home. anyways, i've
started grabbing an hour here and there to work on openlp.org 1.0, and
i'm pleased to say that it looks like i've nearly got the CCLI Song
Select licked.

so once that's done, and if there aren't any other bugs that we know of,
then i'm going to release RC1. unfortunately i can't give a decent
estimate of when i'm going to release it, but i'll keep you updated via
my blog.

raoul...
