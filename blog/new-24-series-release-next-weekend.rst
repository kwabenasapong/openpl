We'd like to release another bug fix version of OpenLP next Sunday, the 26th of June. This should hopefully fix a few
annoying bugs that were uncovered after the last round of bug fixes.

If you are a translator, now is your last chance to get your translation up to date. We are going to be pulling the
`translations`_ from `Transifex`_ (you'll need to log in to see this link) on the morning of Thursday the 23rd. This
means that your **last day** for translating is **Wednesday the 22nd**.
