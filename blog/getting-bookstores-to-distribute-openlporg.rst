I've been formulating a professional e-mail to some of the Christian
bookstore chains here in South Africa, and I decided to make it
available to the openlp.org community. This letter basically just talks
about what openlp.org is, what open source software is, and why we want
them to distribute it.

I've created a forum topic with the letter in it, and I encourage you to
look at the letter, translate it into your language, and decide amongst
yourselves who should be the "openlp.org representative" for your
country. Just remember to keep it sounding professional.

Derek and I have been looking at how much it will cost to print labels
for CDs and give those CDs away. We came to roughly 1 US dollar per CD.
This isn't a lot, and you're welcome to investigate doing this yourself.
I'll post CD labels and other packaging and promotional things later, so
that you can print out and use these things. So if your letter is
successful, you'll be able to download official openlp.org labels and
print them out, and give the bookstores professional looking CDs.

But don't stop there. Why not print out more labels and CDs and hand
them out to folks from other Churches that you might know, so that they
can also benefit from open source software?
