Hi folks,

It is with great pleasure I announce the release date for the first
ALPHA version of OpenLP 2.0: Sunday 28 March 2010.

What is an alpha release? Well, it's a release to say, "hey, we're not
yet done, but you can look at what we've done so far!" Some features are
missing, some are incomplete, and some are buggy, but you can look
around and play around!

It has taken us a year and a half to get to this point, an initial
release of OpenLP 2.0, but this is because we have been rewriting OpenLP
from the ground up. There is not one single small piece of code from
version 1.x in version 2.0. Rewriting OpenLP from scratch has given us a
chance to fix design mistakes in 1.x, add more flexibility, and give you
much much more in version 2.0 than we could have ever given you in 1.x.

I'd like to extend a huge thanks to my fellow developers, testers and
other members of the community for their help, encouragement, and
commitment to a brand new version of OpenLP!
