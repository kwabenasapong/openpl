OpenLP has officially been accepted into openSUSE Factory, which means
that in openSUSE 12.2 users will be able to install openLP right out of
the box, without having to add any additional repositories. openSUSE
12.2 is scheduled to be released on July 11th.

If you're currently running Factory all you have to do to install OpenLP
is run 'zypper install openlp'. For more information, you can visit the
OpenLP build page: https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/106648

Many thanks go to Joseph Mulloy who tirelessly working at it for many
months. He had to fix bugs in other packages and prod people to compile
their packages properly, just so that he could get OpenLP into openSUSE.
It really was quite a mission, but he did so anyways.
