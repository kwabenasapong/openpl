|Translate OpenLP|

Our non-English users would have noticed that some of them can use
OpenLP in their own language. Now, I am an English speaker, so I don't
have any issues using OpenLP as-is, but I can imagine that it would be
way better to be able to use OpenLP in English if it were only available
in another language.

The good news for our non-English users is that we already have a number
of languages which are 100% (or close to 100%) translated.
Unfortunately, the bad news is that not all the translations are
complete, so there are still English words creeping through in a few
translations. Additionally, in order to produce a top-quality final
version of OpenLP, we'll be dropping any incomplete translations from
OpenLP when we release it in 2 weeks time.

Here's the break down of the different translations we currently have:

|Current Status of OpenLP Translations|

Helping out with these translations is easy! Just go to
`Transifex <https://www.transifex.com/>`_ and register, then go to the
`OpenLP project page <https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/openlp/>`_,
and then request to join a language team. Once you've been added to that
team you will receive an e-mail notification, and all you need to do is
login and start translating! It couldn't be simpler!

**Translations need to be completed by midnight Tuesday, 23rd October
UTC.**
