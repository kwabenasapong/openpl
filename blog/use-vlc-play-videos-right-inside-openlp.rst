A few months ago, we rewrote how media (videos, etc) works in OpenLP.
Part of the reason for the rewrite of how media is handled was to be
able to use VLC as your video player inside OpenLP. Today we are happy
to announce that we now have VLC support in OpenLP, via the nightly
builds.

Please keep in mind that the VLC support might contain bugs since it has
not yet been fully tested. Feel free, however, to test it out. As usual,
please report any bugs you find.

*Note:* You will need to install VLC and enable VLC support in the media
setting (Settings -> Configure OpenLP...) before you can use it.

| Best Regards and may God be with you,
| OpenLP Team
