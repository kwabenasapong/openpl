Well, I had to make some adjustments to the CSV Bible Importer because
of the new format of the Bibles, and it was starting to get a little
crowded, so I ended up creating a whole new wizard. This new wizard adds
some new things, only found in the new format Bibles, such as a full
version name, copyright information (required when you display the
verses) and a permission field as well. More on that when RC6 is
released.

In terms of the state of development, we've gotten about half way
through our task list for RC6. Derek has been tied up at work, but he
reckons that he should be getting more free time in the near future, and
he hopes to spend some of that time on openlp.org. I've been getting
time to work on openlp.org since we got back from honeymoon, but I'm
wondering how long that will last. Hopefully long enough for us to get
openlp.org 1.0 out the door.

Just a side note about contacting us, I've been getting a number of
e-mails recently with feature requests, bug reports and support queries.
I don't have the time to go through all of those and then still develop
openlp.org. Please use the correct channels for all those items. The
Contact Us page has all the details of who to contact for what.
