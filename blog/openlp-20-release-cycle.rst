As some folks might have noticed, we released OpenLP 1.9.2 "Hairy
Habakkak" (aka Alpha 2) about three months after we released our first
alpha release. The more adventurous folk might have even noticed that on
the developers' wiki, the rest of the releases are all aimed to be about
3 months apart.

While we aren't 100% set to those timelines, we have mostly decided to
get a new release out every 3 months, for a few reasons:

#. Firstly, to show people that we're actively working on version 2.0. I
   think a lot of folk wondered about it, since we were making a lot of
   noise, but no one had seen anything yet.
#. Secondly, to widen our testing. The more folks who test OpenLP and
   find bugs, the less bugs there will be in the final version.
#. Thirdly, to give ourselves a deadline. This helps us as developers to
   have a goal to aim for, and motivate us to accomplish certain tasks
   by the release date.

With this all in mind, we'll be having a developer's meeting at the end
of August, to asses our progress and see if we want to make a release
happen at the end of September, and what will be included in that
release out of all the features we planned to develop. These developer
meetings are open to anyone who wants to attend, are usually announced
on the developer mailing list, and held in our IRC channel.

You can read up on our proposed releases on our developer wiki. Please
note that these are NOT finalised, they simply serve as a guide for what
we want to achieve.
