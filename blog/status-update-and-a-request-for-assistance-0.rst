Things are looking promising for a release of beta 5 in the next week or
two. I think I've nailed down the video bug and re-worked the theming to
take everyone's preferences into account. You can now set your preferred
theme level to song level, OOS level or global default. I few other
small bugs have also been resolved. The internationalisation feature
will be moved out to beta6.

The one outstanding issue that we wanted to include for beta 5 is the
correction of the CCLI bug. This is where we have a small problem that I
hope someone out there can help me with. The South African CCLI website
does not have the same functionality as the USA website and we can't use
it to test the CCLI interface. With this in mind, I would like to ask if
anyone out there can assist me with a username/password. I will of
course keep it confidential. You can contact me at derek(at)openlp.org.

That's it from me for now.

God bless,

Derek.
