<p>Ever wanted to know how many developers work on OpenLP, or when OpenLP started, or even how many are working on the code at the same time? Well, now you can see this and more with the video above.</p>
<p><strong>Full HD: full screen is highly recommended</strong></p>
<p>This video is a visual representation of the history of changes to the OpenLP source code. Each person floating around is a developer who worked on the code, and each "shot" is a change. Green means they added a file, orange/yellow means a file was modified, and red means a file was deleted (it happens). Each branch is a directory, and each dot is a file.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
