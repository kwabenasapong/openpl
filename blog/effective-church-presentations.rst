One of my pet peeves is those OpenOffice.org Impress or Microsoft
PowerPoint presentations that folks do in churches. I've seen too many
half-hearted efforts in the 28 years I've been in church.

This evening in church we had another presentation, and it got me to
thinking about how to write an effective presentation. So this evening I
wrote up a guide to effective church presentations and posted it to my
personal blog. I hope this helps other folks who want to make their
presentations effective.
