As some folks are aware, the release date of OpenLP 1.9.12 was pushed
back two weeks. This is because we currently do not have enough people
testing out OpenLP and fixing bugs.

We Need Your Help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the final release of OpenLP looming in October, we need as many
people as possible testing out OpenLP and seeing how many new bugs we
can find.

We Need Bugs Found (and Fixed)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We already have a `list of known
bugs <https://bugs.launchpad.net/openlp>`__, and would appreciate folks
checking to see if they can reproduce those bugs, and filing more if
bugs are encountered. Please note that missing functionality is not
considered a bug.

We Need a New Website
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the other needs we have before we release OpenLP is a new website
design. If you're a rocking web designer, we want to see your mock ups
of the site!

We Need a User Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is the `start of a user
guide <https://code.launchpad.net/%7Eraoul-snyman/openlp/user-guide>`__
available, but unfortunately it has been forgotten due to time
constraints. If you'd like to try you hand at completing it, or least
contributing toward it, that too would really help.
