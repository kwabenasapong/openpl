As those who read this blog regularly will know, I've been looking for
folks to help me out with developing openlp.org. A lot of folks have
come forward and offered a range of different ways to help, including
actual application development, but no one has Delphi 7, and therefore
no one can help me with the development of openlp.org 1.2.

With this in mind, at the pitiful amount of progress I've made recently,
I asked the developer mailing list to vote on possibly shelving version
1.2 and moving straight on to 2.0.

The reasons I cited for dropping 1.2 are as follows:

-  Only 1 person working on 1.2 (me)
-  An ever-increasing team of currently about 5 people working on 2.0
   (the cross-platform python version)
-  A lot of work needs to go into 1.2, and about the same amount needs
   to go into 2.0
-  2.0 is essentially going to be a copy of 1.2, just written in a
   totally open source environment

The response I got was unanimous. Everyone agreed that my time and
effort would be better spent working on version 2.0 with everyone else,
rather than duplicating effort on 1.2. This means I am officially
shelving version 1.2, and we're moving ahead with 2.0.

Version 2.0 is being written in Python, using the Qt4 GUI Toolkit, and
PyQt4 to glue Python and Qt4 together. If you're interested in helping
out, please send me a private message.

I will be releasing another bugfix, version 1.0.2, as I mentioned in a
previous post, in the near future, so if you're having any problems with
1.0.1, see the bug report thread in the forums.
