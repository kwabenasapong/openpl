Looking back over the past year, OpenLP has had quite an eventful year.
In 2011 we had the last two releases of openlp.org 1.2.x, had five
releases of OpenLP 2.0 (1.9.x), we moved from alpha releases to beta
releases, and we end-of-life'd openlp.org 1.x. Not only that, OpenLP
even has an Android app!

Both as an application, and as a project, OpenLP has gone from strength
to strength during 2011. Since the first beta release (version 1.9.5) we
have had over 80,000 downloads, and the new manual has seen steady
improvement since it was first put together. There have been a number of
favourable reviews of OpenLP, and we've seen people talking about OpenLP
more on the Internet this year. The OpenLP site has also seen almost
150,000 visitors this year.

This coming year promises to be even bigger and better. While we don't
have a fixed release date for OpenLP 2.0, the general feeling is that it
will likely be toward the end of 2012. This means that lots of bug
fixing lies ahead of us, we'd like to get things like translations and
the manual complete, and look at revamping the web site for the final
release too.

Often we make New Years resolutions but in 2 Corinthians 13:5, Paul
tells us:

    Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test
    yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus
    Christ is in you? - unless indeed you fail to meet the test!"

    2 Corinthians 13:5, ESV

A careful self-evaluation is often insightful and motivating, especially
for Christians working on their New Yearâ€™s resolutions. As we kick off
the new year, take time to examine you faith and confirm your commitment
to Christ, reflecting on what He has done for you this past year, and
thinking of what you can do in the coming year to strengthen your faith
and deepen your relationship with Him.

In short, the OpenLP team wishes you a blessed and fruitful new year.

PS: Don't forget to upgrade OpenLP to version 1.9.8.
