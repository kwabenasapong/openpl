In v1 of openlp.org, there is the option to enable keyboard shortcuts.
However these hotkeys require you to press 3 keys at once, and as such
are not very easy to use.

In v2 we've improved the situation. You can now for example use the left
and right keys to go the previous/next item in the order of service, and
Esc to hide the display. We also plan in the future to add shortcuts to
allow the user to skip straight to a verse or chorus and the ability to
customize the shortcuts.

| However one shortcut we haven't yet implemented is blank screen, and
we're trying to figure out what key to use as the default. The obvious
is "B", but we want to reserve that in the future for "Bridge"...

I've looked at other software, and discovered that there doesn't seem to
be any standard for this. V1 uses Ctrl+Alt+B, SongPro uses Z. OpenSong
uses K. Mediashout uses F6. Easyworship uses Ctrl+B, Words of Worship
uses ESC.

My assumtion so far is that "T" will blank to theme. I'm wondering
whether to change hide the screen to be "H" instead of ESC, which would
affect single screen users the most. Then we could use ESC for blank.
Another option would be "E" for say empty.

So the question is, what key would you prefer or what other suggestions
do you have? We'd prefer to stick to single keys rather than
combinations and reserve any verse tags.
