well, it seems that the sourceforge CVS is back up and running again, so
i've updated the CVS repository. if you want to download the source
code, feel welcome to, just contact me about the extra components you'll
need in order to be able to compile it.

the name of the cvs module is "openlp-old-2".

we're still having those powerpoint problems i mentioned earlier. if you
have ever dealt with delphi and the windows api, would you drop me a
line please?

cheers for now...
