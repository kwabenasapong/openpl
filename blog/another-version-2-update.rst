...with the obligatory screenshot too.

In the screenshot above, you can see how we've started working on
Themes, Previews, and the Slide Controllers. I searched for Genesis 1:1
in the Bible Verse plugin, and then sent it to the preview controller.

We're currently working on the Service Manager (what used to be called
the Order of Service) to make it a little more powerful that the
previous one, and on getting things displayed on the second monitor. We
already have some initial bits to both of those working, but neither is
complete yet.
