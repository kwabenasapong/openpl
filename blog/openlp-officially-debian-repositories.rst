|Debian - The Universal Operating System|

Ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely happy to announce that as from
today you can install OpenLP in `Debian Linux <http://debian.org/>`_
(unstable) by simply typing in ``apt-get install openlp`` - yes, that's
right, OpenLP is in the Debian repositories.

This is a really significant step for OpenLP because a number of the
really popular Linux distributions are based on Debian, and thus OpenLP
will filter down into distributions like Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Linux Mint
in the near future. For instance, you should find OpenLP in Ubuntu 12.10
when it comes out in October this year.
