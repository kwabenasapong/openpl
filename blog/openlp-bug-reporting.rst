OpenLP is getting closer and closer to the release of version 2.0. As we
draw nearer to that date more and more of you are testing it out and
that is great. Testing helps the developers fix both problems large and
small before the final release. There are, however, a few things we as
testers can do to help the process along.

The preferred place to report bugs is through email to: bugs at
openlp.org.

Here are some thing that need to be included to speed the process up:

-  First please read the Frequently Asked Questions.
-  What Operating System you are using: Windows, Mac, Linux (please
   include the distro also) OpenLP is crossplatform so this is very
   important.
-  Please include what build of OpenLP you are using, such as the
   relases: Alpha 3, Alpha 4, etc. Or you may possibly be using a build
   other than a release, you can find this info from Help -> About
   OpenLP. An example of a build number is: 1.9.4-bzr1264 where 1264 is
   the build number.
-  Please also include how you got the release of OpenLP if you
   downloaded a release, a nightly build, from your Linux distro's
   package manager, or from bzr.
-  If something such as a file import fails, please attach that file.
-  If something looks wrong, missing, out of place, or something that is
   hard to describe, please include a screenshot. Many times a picture
   truly is worth a thousand words.
-  Write in detail every step involved to make the occurrence happen.
   Please write this in a very clear way so that someone can know
   nothing about the issue and follow step by step how to replicate the
   bug.
-  After writing the detailed explanation of how to produce the bug,
   follow that explanation before sending and make sure you can
   replicate the results.
-  Pleas also include the debug file, you can find info on how to do
   that in the Frequently Asked Questions.

Please also be courteous in your correspondence. Remember that all the
developers are volunteers. They are donating their time and using their
skills as programmers not just to make a living but also as a ministry.
Since this is a part time endeavour for them please exercise patience.

All the testing is very much appreciated, we are just trying to get the
info to the developers in a way that will help them do the most with
their time as they fix problems, and add new features. OpenLP 2.0 is set
to be a fantastic release and that is due to the efforts of a wonderful
community that is developing, testing, and using OpenLP.
