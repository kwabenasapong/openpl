So, over the last few months I've been doing more and more C++, and have
been loving working with it. As my time is freeing up a little bit with
regard to doing personal projects again, I've started work on a Cross
Platform version of openlp.org based on the wxWidgets framework. The
progress so far is stellar, in 3 days I've nailed most of the
fundamental GUI features, and hopefully this completely open development
platform will open up opportunities for more people to work on the
project. I'll start uploading source into SVN in the next few days. The
big advantage of this framework, for the non-techies among you, is that
it can compile to binary on Mac, Linux and Windows; with support for all
the libraries that openlp.org needs.

Oh and you can see my band, Glass Darkly in concert live at CreationFest
this summer - or any number of other places around the UK, and the US.
Keep tabs on the website for more info.

I'll keep you posted on any new developments.
