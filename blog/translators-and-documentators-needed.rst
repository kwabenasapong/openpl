Hey guys!

As you might have noticed, openlp.org's development is progressing
pretty nicely. It's been a long time, and a long process (hectic
personal schedules leave little time for pet projects like openlp.org),
but we're finally nearing 1.0.

| BUT in order for us to have a really nicely finished and polished
product, we need documentation. We're looking for people who are willing
to put aside a couple of hours a week (say about 2 - 4) and, in a
collaborative manner, put together a user guide second to none. If
you're interested in joining us, then please contact us via the contact
form (subject: Help with documentation).

We also need people who are willing to translation this site (and
therefore the documentation) into other languages. If you speak German,
French, Spanish, Portuguese, or anything else, and you'd like to help
out, then please contact us via the contact form (subject: Help with
translation). Please remember that I don't speak anything other than
English, so don't e-mail me in your language, I won't understand what
you're saying.
