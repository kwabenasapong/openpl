ladies and gents, i have all the source code for openlp.org 1.0 (thanks
tim!) and have started to remove the bugs that i know of. i'm going to
start a topic in the forums about bugs in beta 1 and beta 2. post your
bug reports there, but please make sure they're not listed already.

hopefully i should have RC1 out by the end of next week. no promises
though. things are hectic at work, and i'm leaving my current job at the
end of this month (feb) to start a new one in march.

keep your eyes peeled!
