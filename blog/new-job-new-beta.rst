howdy folks!

yes, you heard correct, there's a new beta coming up in the next couple
of days. derek has been working hard the last couple of weeks (more like
2 months i think) and has fixed the powerpoint issue it seems. he's also
made some improvements to the interface, and even reworked the themes
slightly. many thanks to him for his dedication and hard work!

in other news, i have yet another new job. this one looks much more
permanent that the last lot. i at least have an initial year long
contract. i also have a decent salary that will cover my expenses
nicely. my expenses are also about to decrease, since i'm taking the
train to work, and it's FAR cheaper than the petrol for the car. i'm
praying that things are looking up.

well, that's all from my side for now.

God bless!
