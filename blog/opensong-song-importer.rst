Well, on Sunday afternoon I didn't have much to do, so I decided to sit
down and write an OpenSong to openlp.org song importer. And I did.
Except it had a few bugs. Then I couldn't stop thinking about it, so
yesterday evening I sat down and found and fixed those bugs.

In the mean time, Justin Corwin has been at it again, writing a bunch
more utilities, including an OpenSong song importer.

You can look at all the utilities on the Utilities page.Â
