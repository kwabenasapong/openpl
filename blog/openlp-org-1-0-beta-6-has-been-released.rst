Yes folks, that moment has finally arrived! I have released openlp.org
1.0 beta 6. This is the last beta release of openlp.org, the next
release will be Release Candidate 1, where we hope to have the majority
of bugs out of the system.

One of the big highlights of this new release is the translation. Want
openlp.org in your own translation? Just copy the english.xml file, open
it and replace the strings in there with translations of your own
language, import the new xml file, and then select your new translation!

There are a number of other small improvements here and there, including
a few feature requests. Plenty bugs have been squashed too, although I
doubt it's all of them.

Well, download openlp.org from the download page, and post your bugs to
the forum topic.
