This is a little late, but better late than never... I want to welcome
Jon Tibble to the OpenLP 2.0 core development team.

Jon has been helping us out with come coding recently, and has proven
himself to be a real asset. He's not only been working on some of the
bigger things, he's also gone in and worked on a lot of the smaller bits
that we haven't been able to devote time to. He's got a real eye for
detail and is a meticulous developer.

So, from me and all the rest of the core developers: Welcome Jon!
