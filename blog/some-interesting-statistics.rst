The other day I decided to check what our project activity on
SourceForge.net looks like. I was quite surprised to see that our
activity is sitting at just over 99% (they rate it up to 2 decimal
places), so I went to go and have a look at how many times openlp.org
RC6 has been downloaded.

What a pleasant surprise! As of this blog post, openlp.org RC6 has been
downloaded 614 times. That equates to 5.21 gigs of data being
downloaded. Wow. I didn't realise it was that much!

Last week, openlp.org's activity was 99.73%, and by close of day
yesterday we were ranked 517 out of 166,587 projects. That's no mean
feat, especially since we don't have a particularly large project!

If we can get over 600 downloads after only 3 weeks, just imagine how
many downloads we could amass after the launch of version 1.0!

In other news, we've just started Test Phase 1, to see if we can catch
as many of the remaining bugs as possible before we launch version 1.0.
If you'd like to be part of these test phases, please e-mail me.

Lastly, I'm still trying to single-handedly write all the documentation
myself. As of yet I \*still\* haven't had anyone who has actually done
anything more than offer me empty words. If you really have more than
just good intentions and hollow words, please let me know.
