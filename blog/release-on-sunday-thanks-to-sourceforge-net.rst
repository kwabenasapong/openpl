It's a plain fact: SourceForge.net's servers suck. We moved the site
away from them, we've moved our project management tools away from them,
and I think I might just move entirely away from them.

I'm on dialup here at home. Which is slow. So it takes a HECK of a long
time to upload the 7.5 megabyte install file for openlp.org. So you can
imagine how unimpressed I am that the file upload failed at 95%. You can
imagine then that I'm even less impressed with the fact that you cannot
manually delete a file from their upload server, and that you have to
wait 24 hours before the is automatically deleted. And that for some or
other unknown reason I cannot log in to the shell server to upload the
file there and then move it across to the upload server.

So, as much as I am ready for a Friday release, SourceForge.net's
pathetic service is not. So please be patient while I wait.
