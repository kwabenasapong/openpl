howdy folks...

i just want to apologise for the silence. i've been extremely busy, and
then suddenly, after i thought, "yay! i have a nice job, a steady
income!" our boss's contract was terminated, and that meant that we were
out of work (we were subcontracted). so now i sit again without work,
looking at the freelancing scene, wondering if i can make it... there
seems to be a bit of work at the moment, but i'm not sure...

and this other freelance work that i have been doing has been keeping me
up late nights and things... let me tell you, working 20 hours days is
not funny :-(.

well, i hope that now with a little more time on my hands i can perhaps
get some more done on openlp.org...

thanks for your patience!
