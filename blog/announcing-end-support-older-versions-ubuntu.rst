|Ubuntu 12.04|

The OpenLP team has always supported older versions of Ubuntu, even when
they were no longer supported by Canonical. Unfortunately this places a
strain on the team and on which tools we can use to continue developing
OpenLP. For this reason we have decided to only support versions of
Ubuntu that Canonical themselves support.

Recently Canonical announced that they would be ending support for
Ubuntu 10.04 and 11.10 at the end of April. This means that only
versions of Ubuntu 12.04 and higher are supported by Canonical. OpenLP
therefore will only be supporting releases on Ubuntu 12.04 and higher as
of immediately. This also means that the upcoming 2.0.2 bugfix release
of OpenLP will only be available on Ubuntu 12.04 and higher.

Since 12.04 is the latest Long Term Support release of Ubuntu, we are
hoping that this should not affect anyone. If you are affected, and
there is some reason why you cannot upgrade to a later version of
Ubuntu, you can come into our IRC channel and chat with us about getting
OpenLP running on your computer.
