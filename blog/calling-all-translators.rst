So you've been hearing all this noise about OpenLP 2.0 coming out,
you've seen screenshots, and you're wondering if this new version will
be available in your language. Perhaps you're wanting to contribute, but
you're not a "computer person"?

Well, with OpenLP 2.0, we'd like to be more open, and that includes
translations. If you speak a language other than English, and you want
to help translate OpenLP 2.0 into your language, please take a look at
the Translations section of the developer wiki.

**Note:** We're still in the process of setting up the translation
tools, but we will feature an online tool, so you don't need to install
anything on your computer, nor do you need to be able to do anything
terribly technical.
