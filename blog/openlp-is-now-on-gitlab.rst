One of the steps toward OpenLP 3.0 was moving to git and GitLab, and this has now been completed.
After many years on Launchpad and using Bazaar, it was clear to us that unfortunately there was no
future in either of those, due to them being all but abandoned by their developers.

You can now find OpenLP on GitLab: https://gitlab.com/openlp/openlp

Further News
------------

We've also recently made great strides toward an alpha release recently. The new rendering engine
is almost complete, and the VLC-based media framework is also pretty much done. There are a couple
more minor things like bug fixes and general cleanup that need to be done, and then we're going to
release OpenLP 3.0 Alpha 1.

Again, we don't have an exact date, but it will be pretty soon.
