At last, after five hours of labour, the new mother was resting with her
newborn son gently nursing while her husband was taking care of the last
few things after the birth. It hadn't been an easy day and she was glad
that it was over.

After a number of days' travel, they had reached their destination, the
so-called "City of David." However, even after the journey was over,
they struggled to find accommodation. Eventually, an old innkepper,
seeing a heavily pregnant woman, had pity on them and offered them the
only place he had left open, his stables. And it wasn't over yet, just
as they settled down, Mary's labour started. Now everything was over,
and they could finally rest.

Joseph put the last of the cloths in the bucket of washing water, and
walked over to his wife. Despite the hour and the preceding labour, her
face was glowing, and she was happy. He looked down at the boy in his
wife's arms, and thought back to the miracle of how the Lord had made
his wife pregnant, despite her being a virgin.

While this boy was not technically his, Joseph already regarded the baby
as his own. One day, this little Jesus would save the world, but until
then, he needed a father here on earth.

    And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. And
    she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling
    cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them
    in the inn.

    Luke 2:6-7 ESV

To all our brothers and sisters in Christ, we wish you a blessed
Christmas.
