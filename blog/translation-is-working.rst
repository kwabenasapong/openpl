Many thanks to Derek for his sharp eyes! Derek had another glance over
my code and spotted a few things, and managed to get the translation
working. I'm now busy cleaning up the code, finishing it off, and
hopefully should be releasing beta 6 later this coming week.

openlp.org 1.0 beta 6 contains the last of the new features. After beta
6 we will be releasing release candidate 1, and from there we have maybe
1 or 2 more release candidates, and then it's 1.0 final! I'm looking
forward to releasing version 1 and I know you are too!

| Thanks for supporting our project!
