Well, this weekend I released Release Candidate 3, with a few more
improvements (they're not really new features, but they are improvements
to existing features). So Derek and I were chatting last night about the
current state of openlp.org, and we are pretty sure that if there are no
more bugs in RC4, we will release 1.0.

In terms of the distribution (or marketing) pack, a designer friend of
mine who has been associated with openlp.org since the early days has
had a bit of time on his hands recently and has been having a go at
designing posters and the like. I'm going to see how far he has got, and
then we can start putting the pack together.

However, we still need people to assist with the documentation. This is
an area that is sadly lacking, and neither Derek nor I have the time to
write up the documentation. If you see yourself being able to help out,
please contact us, either through the site contact form, or by e-mailing
**support-at-openlp.org**, or by e-mailing me personally at
**raoul-at-openlp.org**.
