Hi folks,

For those who haven't realised it yet, version 1.0 is in maintenance
mode. This means that we are no longer working on it, apart from fixing
the occasional bug. This also means that we are no longer supporting
anyone else trying to compile or further develop 1.0 because it has
reached it's end of life.

If you're keen to add features or otherwise help with the development of
openlp.org, please work on version 2.0. We have a developer wiki with
some articles on how to get started on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, and
other important pages like coding standards and a plugin developers'
guide.

You're also welcome to join us in IRC, where we have developers, users,
and friends of openlp.org hanging out and chatting from time to time.
