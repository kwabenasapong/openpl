V1.2.3 is mainly a bug fix release, with 1 or 2 small enhancements.

-  A correction for a theme edit bug where the horizontal and vertical
   alignment sometimes went haywire
-  A correction for an error when loading a image file for a theme
   background which contains international characters
-  A correction was made to the "Add Song Wizard" which fixed a bug
   where songs were not being saved.
-  Improved handling of Bible imports to avoid importing a bible with
   the same name as an existing bible.
-  When displaying verses in the Live window, the slide list now
   auto-scrolls up to show the next slide in the same way as the lyrics
   slides.
-  A change made to the SongSelect web import. The mechanism for
   importing songs now monitors the lyrics export to file function in
   the webpage. The reason for the change is because the lyrics are now
   embedded as a PNG file and not as raw text.

I had hoped to release this for Christmas, but hey, at least it's still
THIS YEAR ... only just though ;-)
