Work on the 2.0 version is moving forward at great speed with new
developers helping out.

In the last few weeks code has been added to run Impress presentations
on Linux. Work is underway to get this to also work on Windows.
Powerpoint and PowerPoint Viewer will come later.

In the latest merge a new Audit plugin has arrived to audit songs used
during a service. This will record what was actually used during a
service. More work is needed on this component but the foundations are
complete.

The other month an extension to the alerting component was added allow
alerts to be triggered over a network.Â  This will be useful for creche's
and car park attendants
