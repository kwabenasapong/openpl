One of the questions we get every now and then is "When is openlp.org 2
going to be released?"

To be honest, we have no idea. We're working on it whenever we get a
chance, and I must say that the pace that we're getting things working
is actually quite amazing. Many thanks go out to Scott Guerrieri, Martin
Thompson and Tim Bentley who have done most of the work so far.

But, before I go on, let me show you a few screenshots on Mac OS X:

If you look in the screenshots above, you'll get a good idea of how the
plugins system works. In the main window, you can see each of the items
in the media manager. Each of these items is provided by a plugin. In
the settings form you can see the tabs at the top of the window. Those
tabs (apart from the core tabs - General, Themes and Alerts) are also
provided by the plugin system.

The Songs plugin also provides the Song Editor form, which is called up
and manages the songs. You can also see the Custom Slide Editor form
that the Custom Slide plugin provides.

Eventually, the plugins will even be able to respond to events within
openlp.org!

We still have a lot of work to do, but things are progressing nicely. If
you'd like to find out how to help out with the development of version
2, have a look at the Getting Started page on our developer wiki.
