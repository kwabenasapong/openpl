Well, we're still working on beta 6. It's **almost** there... I
implemented the internationalization, but to my dismay it's not working.
I'm going to look into it further to see if I can work out what's wrong.
So hopefully, if I can figure that out soon, we can have beta 6 out by
the end of this week, next week the latest.

Thanks also to a post in the forums, we think we might have solved the
CCLI SongSelect login problem. We're gonna also be looking at fixing
that this week. Derek has also managed to pick up another 2 bugs and has
fixed one of them in the mean time.

Like I think I mentioned in my previous blog post, we're going to RC1
next release, so that's gonna call for intense testing. So get your
testing gear out, and pile into beta 6 and RC1 when they are released.
