I've had various offers in the past for help with the documentation, and
I'm sad to say those have all fallen through. However, someone has
contacted me, and he seems VERY keen to help out with the documentation.

One of the things I have been wanting to do is to extract the
documentation from the site, and be able to work on it "offline" as it
were. To this end, I extracted the documentation in XML format, and I'm
writing a little editor that will be able to parse the XML and allow you
to edit the pages of the documentation using a WYSIWYG HTML editor
(currently it can do all of that, it just can't save).

So, if you're still interested in helping out with the documentation,
you think you can spare an hour a week perhaps, then please contact me,
and I'll give you stuff to do!
