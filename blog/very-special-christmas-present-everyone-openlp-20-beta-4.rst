|Christmas Present|

Another release, another beta... As with most other open source
projects, we don't want to release OpenLP until it is ready. So here's
our Christmas present to you: another beta version. Don't worry, we are
just as eager as you to get the final release out, but we also want to
make sure the final release is the best it can be, so we'll continue to
release beta versions and then release candidates until we're happy with
what we've got.

PLEASE NOTE: ONCE YOU HAVE INSTALLED VERSION 1.9.8 YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RUN VERSION 1.9.7 AGAIN!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*As of 1.9.7 we introduced an automatic database upgrade system, and
song databases from the newer versions are not necessarily backwards
compatible. From time to time we have to introduce changes to the songs
database in order to add new features and enhance existing
functionality. Because of these changes, you will not be able to run
previous versions of OpenLP with your most recent database.*

This release is no different to the last one, chock-full of bug fixes,
with a few features, or feature enhancements, thrown in. We are also
constantly updating `the manual
(http://manual.openlp.org/) <http://manual.openlp.org/>`_ to reflect
these new features and enhancements and a lot of changes have already
been documented.

Some of the features you'll find in this release:

-  A top toolbar in the web remote
-  `Media has been
   rewritten <http://www.openlp.org/en/blog/2011/12/02/media-rewrite-complete>`_
   to make integration of other media systems, like VLC, easier.
-  Added "Justify" as a theme option (note: this makes themes not
   backward compatible if this option is used)
-  Ability to edit songs loaded as part of a service which are not
   stored permanently in the songs database.
-  `Special
   shortcuts <http://www.openlp.org/en/blog/2011/11/06/shortcuts-live-controller-video>`_
   for the slide controller to go directly to any verse.

Some of the bug fixes you'll find in this release:

-  Support for OS X 10.7 Lion
-  A couple of minor bugfixes for the Web Remote
-  Problems with v1 theme with non-english characters in the name
-  Problems with non-english characters in filenames inside loaded
   services on Windows
-  Cannot use mouse wheel to change volume in slide controller
-  Improve performance of song loading for Preview/Live
-  OpenLP 2 database import fails when using an old database
-  Specified position for footer not working
-  Theme with outlined text and "justify" not displaying properly

    For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government
    will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor,
    Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

    Isaiah 9:6

Christmas is a hectic time of year with people shopping for gifts,
wrapping gifts, traveling, preparing meals and doing so many other
activities. For those of us involved in church preparation it will also
include Christmas themes, song selection, music rehearsal and other
preparations for the Christmas service. Sometimes Christmas looks like a
big production.

On the other hand, there are governments requiring Nativity scenes to be
taken down, atheists wanting to put banners up denying God, TV
broadcasts and stores restricted to say "Happy Holidays" instead of
Merry CHRISTmas and Christians watching in unbelief as our faith is
assaulted.

We can take comfort in knowing we worship a living, caring God. One who
sent His Son to show us how to live, to pray, to worship and to believe
in our Lord Jesus for everlasting life.

We at OpenLP wish you a Blessed Christmas and hope and pray you will
take the time to refresh yourself with Jesus Christ, our Wonderful
Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father and Prince of Peace. Amen.
