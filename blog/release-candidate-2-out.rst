Hi there folks!

I've just uploaded openlp.org 1.0 RC2 to the SourceForge servers. This
release fixes a few bugs that we have noted before, the main one being
the loading of saved order of services. We also rewrote the Bible CSV
importer, so this should work as advertised. As usual, you can download
it from the Download page.

Once again, please post your bug reports in the appropriate forum topic.
Please also read through the documentation on how to submit a bug report
before submitting a bug.
