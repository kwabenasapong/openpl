Hi folks,

I've just put together a very basic tutorial on how to get your first
service up and running. I've embedded it below in HTML5 video. If you
can't see it, you can download it and watch it in VLC using the link
below, or you'll have to wait a little until I've uploaded it to our
YouTube channel.
