For anyone who wants to keep up to date with regular builds I will be
updating my personal repository which is compatible with Package
Manager.  The repos definition can be found
at http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/trb143/OpenLP/.

To obtain this version instead of the normal Fedora updates you will
need to use \ *"--disablerepo=updates"*

Add this and you will get regular updates outside the normal build
cycles.

Bugs for these builds should be logged on Launchpad or IRC not bugzilla.
