hi folks...

well, for those of you who maybe actually read my blog, here is what is
currently happening...

well, firstly, i'm working on a freelance basis until the end of the
month. then i start this job that i was supposed to start in feb of this
year. thanks to this company that stuffed me around a bit, my fincances
are VERY thin. i'm barely making it financially and any prayer is very
much appreciated.

secondly, i'm very busy otherwise, due to church commitments mainly, and
then this freelance work (as any freelancer knows, you're \*always\*
working - well, except for sundays). so i have't had much chance to look
at openlp.org.

however, i have had a bit of a look at it, and there are a few things in
the pipeline at the moment.

there's a fairly major "bug". there's a couple of SQL statements which
makes large databases with many authors take \*FOREVER\* to load, thus
making the program appear to hang when it is started. i'm trying to
figure out one query that will do all the work, and quickly, but i never
wrote the majority of the code in openlp.org 1.0 and on top of that i
have never used sqlite before. so i'm wading through these things, but
i'm getting there.

also, one of the features that has been frequently requested since the
0.9x days is multilingual support. this actually looks to be \*fairly\*
trivial to implement, so i'm busy with that too at the moment. so
hopefully i'll have beta4 out soon with multilingual support in it!

other than that, i don't have much to say...

God bless folks!
