Hi folks,

We've decided to hold a developers meeting on Monday at 20:00 GMT in the
openlp.org IRC channel. If you are interested in helping out with the
development of openlp.org version 2.x, then please feel free to come and
see what we're chatting about.

If you're not a programmer, then please don't worry about this. We're
just going to be chatting about our plans for how to develop openlp.org
2.0.

Our IRC channel can be found on the Freenode network, and the channel
itself is #openlp.orgÂ
