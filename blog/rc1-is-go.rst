hi folks,

FINALLY! i have managed to get rid of the last few bugs (that i know of)
in openlp.org, and i'm about to release RC1 (Release Candidate 1). i'm
waiting on the documentation guys to update the help file with the few
changes that there are, and then i'll release the install file.

i'm looking for someone who has delphi 7.0 (not personal) and who would
like to write an importer application to import songs from one
openlp.org database to another. it shouldn't be too much work (probably
about 5 hours max), but i don't have the time at the moment to work on
it. if you'd like to help, pop me an e-mail and let me know.

well, that's all for now, thanks for your patience.

raoul.
