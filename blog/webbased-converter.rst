With the development of openlp.org 2.0, and a new database format in
2.0, we are (obviously) going to be writing a converter to convert
databases from 1.0 format to 2.0 format. A little bit of discussion
around the converter in the IRC channel last night gave us a brilliant
idea: make the converter web-based.

Having a web-based converter means that we have a central converter that
we can control, and things can happen instantly and in one place. This
means that the bugs you find will be fixed fairly quickly. It also means
that we can add features easily, and you don't have to download yet
another application or upgrade your existing application.

As of this moment, I haven't started working on the converter yet, but
it will be my main priority over the next while, as we developers need
it to migrate our own existing databases!

That's all for now, God bless!
