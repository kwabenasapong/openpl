A couple of us have started working on the forms in openlp.org,
recreating the 1.0 forms in Qt Designer, the interface designer for the
cross-platform Qt UI framework. I decided to take a couple of
screenshots so that folks can get a taste of where we're going...

Please remember that this is not the final product. These are the first
few drafts of \*just\* the interface. There's no functionality behind
any of the windows yet. You can click on each image to download a
full-sized version.

First up, here's a preview of the main form:

Here's the settings form so far:

And, just to show you that this works on other platforms, here is a
earlier version of the main window on Mac OS X:

If you'd like to find out more about helping out with the development,
please join us in IRC.
