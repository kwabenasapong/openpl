Over the last few weeks the alerts framework has been extended, adding
new requested features.

These features include.

-  The ability to change the alert Font size.  The Background will
   resize to fit.
-  The ability to place the alerts at the Top or Bottom of the screen
-  The ability to store all alerts issued.
-  The ability to add / amend / delete from the alerts history.
-  The ability to select and resubmit an existing alert.  This does not
   re-save it unless the text has been changed.
