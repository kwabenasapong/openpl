Hi All. 

With V1.0.1 release coming up soon, Raoul and I were thinking of
possibly bundling a few additional themes with the openlp.org
distribution.  I'm sure there are many of you out there who have
designed some pretty awesome themes. Well, how about sharing them with
everyone?

The only limitation, will be that they have to use **free** fonts and
**free** images. Please submit your fonts with your exported theme files
if necessary to either derekscotney[at]openlp.org or
raoulsnyman[at]openlp.org.

We look forward to seeing what you have put together.

Blessings,

Derek.
