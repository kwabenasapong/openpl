Howdy folks,

Some new things: Well, we're now using activeCollab as our main project
management tool. It's much easier and less confusing to use than
SourceForget.net , and it helps us keep track of everything that's going
on. I've even changed the "Project Page" link to point to our
activeCollab instance. If you'd like to check out what's happening, log
in with username/password guest/guest. You should be able to view
everything.

Some old things: Progress on beta 6 is good. We've actually introduced a
few new things in it that we decided couldn't wait, and would need to be
in 1.0 final in any case to make it a decent software release.

That's all from my side for now.

God bless!Â
