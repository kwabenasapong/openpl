Hello everyone,

As Raoul has already announced testing time is here. I have been asked
to help organize this effort. I have a pretty good list of possible
testers, but the more the merrier.Â  I have already emailed many of you,
if I haven't yet I will be getting to that soon (its a holiday weekend
in the States and I've been more out of pocket than I thought). Here is
a link for some info on testing openlp.org. If you are interested in
testing just send me PM from the openlp.org site. Any help we can get
will be greatly appreciated!
