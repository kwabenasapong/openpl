It's difficult to tell just how popular an open source project is, but
with OpenLP's Facebook following growing it seems safe to say that
OpenLP's popularity is also growing. Version 2.0 is really starting to
look like a mature finished product. The recent release of the first
beta has been very positive. We are now suggesting that all new users
start out with 2.0 Beta 1, since support has now officially ended for
the 1.x series and 2.0 has reached a very stable point in its
development.

The OpenLP community is constantly growing and changing. We can always
use an extra hand as OpenLP is a large project. We could especially use
assistance writing the documentation for version 2.0. The developers are
working hard to make sure that OpenLP is not just an alternative to
commercial software but that it is a superior option. Part of being a
superior product is having great documentation and support. If you are
like me and not a programmer but would like to help out, maybe assisting
with documentation is a place you can help out. If documentation is not
for you, but you are good at helping others we can always use help
answering questions in the forums or providing support in IRC.

Since I am someone whose church has been blessed by the developers of
OpenLP I would like to also take a moment to thank them for their hard
work and dedication. It is rare, even in the Christian world, for a
group of people to set out to do something with no hope of physical or
monetary reward. The developers of OpenLP truly are doing this by making
this product available to all and asking nothing in return.Â  As we enter
the Easter season may we all be more like this and ultimately learn from
Christ selflessness as he gave himself for us who did not deserve it.

    5But he was wounded for our transgressions; he was crushed for our
    iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and
    with his stripes we are healed.

    Isaiah 53:5, ESV
