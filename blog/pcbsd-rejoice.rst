I'm very happy to tell everyone who uses PC-BSD and is looking for free
church presentation software for PC-BSD that OpenLP is now available for
that platform as well. Kris Moore of PC-BSD has kindly packaged OpenLP
for us, and you can find the package on pbiDIR.com. Many thanks to Kris
for helping get OpenLP onto another platform!
