Well, as you have probably already read in one of Raoul's recent blog's,
we are planning a big launch for the V1.0 release of OpenLP.org.  With
that in mind, we have decided to add a few of the smaller but more
useful features from the feature request list.  This comes with the
price of a slightly delayed V1.0, and possibly a few more Release
Candidate versions.  Our feeling though was that there really were some
area's that needed enhancing prior to a major distribution release. You
can look forward to the following enhancements coming in the next few
release candidates:

* Enhanced Bible Verse handing where you can display multiple verses on one slide
* Some keyboard navigation (actually I think it's in RC2 already)
* Enhanced slide auto-scrolling
* Import/Export of themes
* Storage of theme data exclusively in the 'theme' directory in XML format

There may be 1 or 2 other things, but these are the main ones as we
didn't want to impact our timeline too much.

God Bless,

Derek
