|OpenLP Media Kit|

As promised (though more than a few days), I've created a basic media or
press kit. I'll add more to the media kit as time goes by, but I wanted
to get something out there now so that folks can start promoting OpenLP
on their own sites and blogs.

In the initial version of the media kit, you'll find the following:

-  An OpenLP branded wallpaper in the follwing display ratios: 16:10,
   16:9, 4:3 and 5:4.
-  The OpenLP icon in the following sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64,
   128x128, 256x256 and 420x420.
-  An 80x15 badge for your website.
-  A project summary document for a quick blurb on websites.
-  Sample interview questions and answers for anyone who wants to
   interview the team (or wants an interview but doesn't want to
   actually interview us!).

As I gather more items, I'll add them to the media kit, so be on the
look out for more updates, including more wallpapers and website badges.

For Windows uers, and those who like zip files, you can download
`OpenLP-MediaKit.zip <http://sourceforge.net/projects/openlp/files/mediakit/OpenLP-MediaKit.zip/download>`_,
and those who prefer tarballs can download
`OpenLP-MediaKit.tar.gz <http://sourceforge.net/projects/openlp/files/mediakit/OpenLP-MediaKit.tar.gz/download>`_.

Now go forth and multiply!
