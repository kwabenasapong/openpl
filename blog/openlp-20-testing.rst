The developers of openlp have really been burning it up here lately.
There are some really neat things happening. The testing, however has
been a little slow (mainly due to me dragging my feet) so we are needing
a little help on the testing front. As most of you that are testers of
2.0 know, the developers  want to use full regression testing for
version 2.0. Full regression testing pretty much means no stone goes
unturned, and every possible scenario is played out in testing before
the release. To accomplish this we need to write test scripts for
everyone to follow so we know that things have been checked out
completely on a variety of hardware, operating system environments, etc.

If you are interested in helping write some of the scripts we are
breaking them down per plugin. For example the songs plugin will have a
set of test as will the themes plugin, etc. This is fairly involved
process but really helps you get to know the software well and is a way
for those of us who can't or don't have the time to help with the coding
to make a contribution. You can check out what we have so far here. The
basics are making sure everything that should be there is there and
making sure that everything that is there works. If you are interested
in helping out let me know so we won't have two people working on the
same thing or join us over in irc at #openlp.org.
