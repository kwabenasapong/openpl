We have finally had some time to sift through the responses to the
survey, and below I present to you the summary of the survey. There are
some pretty graphs (for those who like graphs) and we've included the
percentages of multiple choice questions. Note that due to most of the
questions allowing more than one answer, the sum of the percentages will
exceed 100%.

And so, without further ado, here are the results:

Top ten features requested
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have selected the top 10 features requested by the respondents. Note
that we will concentrate on these features first, but that doesn't mean
we'll only concentrate on these 10 features. As we complete features
we'll move down the list.

What do you love about OpenLP?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For this question, we had to manually work through everyone's responses,
and pick out the most common themes. These are the top 5 themes we
noticed, in order of most-mentioned to least-mentioned.

#. Free/open source
#. Ease of use/usability/simplicity
#. Feature set
#. Developers/development/community
#. Cross platform

There were also a number of enthusiastic users of the remote and/or
Android app.

We also noticed that some folk thought that OpenLP is donateware. It is
not, we haven't publically accepted donations for a few reasons, mostly
that we don't see the need. If you *would* like to donate, please
`e-mail us (contact form) <http://openlp.org/support/email-us>`__.

What do you dislike about OpenLP?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once again, we had to manually work through everyone's responses, and
pick out the most common themes. These are the top 5 themes we noticed,
in order of most-mentioned to least-mentioned.

#. Bugs and/or crashes
#. Video issues
#. Presentation issues (PowerPoint, Impress, etc)
#. Speed issues
#. Unfamiliarity with OpenLP

We noticed that there were a large number of bugs that we've never heard
of. If you do encounter a bug, please let us know! We can't fix it if we
don't know about it.

There were also a lot of "missing feature" complaints, which were almost
all already in the list of features we're looking to implement, and thus
we did not include them in these results.

Helping with development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We couldn't help but notice that a few of the respondents indicated a
willingness to help develop OpenLP in some way. If you're keen to take a
look at helping out, please see our `getting
started <http://wiki.openlp.org/#Development>`__ page on the developer
wiki and `join us in IRC <http://openlp.org/support/live-chat-irc>`__ so
that we can help you get up and running.

As always, God bless, and happy projecting!
