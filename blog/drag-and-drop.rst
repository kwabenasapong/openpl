Today changes have been added to OpenLP v2 allow Images, Presentations
and Media items to be dragged from the desktop (or any folder) into the
relevent  media manager plugin.  This will allow the selected items to
be loaded more quickly.

If a folder is selected then all the contects of the folder will be
added. When the items are added, only items withe correct file suffix
for the plugin will be loaded. So if you try to drop a presentation into
the images folder, an error message will be generated.

In addition it is possible now to drag saved services into the service
manager.  The service will be opened up and the existing service
replaced.
