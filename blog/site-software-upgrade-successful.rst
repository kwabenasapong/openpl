I'm happy to announce that the software upgrade of the site went well,
and things should be mostly back to normal. If you have any issues with
the site, please just drop us a line in our IRC channel. Please make
sure you mention the page you were going to, the URL you ended up on,
and the exact error you got. Also please note that most folks are only
awake and active in the afternoon and evening hours of UTC/GMT.
