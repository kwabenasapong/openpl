Hi guys,

Just a quick update - I'm still around. Sort of.. Raoul is now handling
the main running of openlp.org. I have got married and started a new job
with an open source consultancy and things have been rather hectic.
However, I do still hope that in the future I can have a hand in the
direction and development of openlp.org, and wanted to thank everyone
for taking us over 27000 downloads of openlp.org in our life time.

I would love to continue hearing from you on what direction you would
like openlp.org to take, and what new features you would like. A Linux
version is still in the pipeline, as are a number of other developments
- keep your eyes peeled!

Tim
