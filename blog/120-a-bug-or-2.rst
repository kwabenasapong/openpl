Well, it would appear as if there are 1 or 2 small (?) issues that I
missed in my testing.  Firstly, it's important to select a monitor in
the First Run Wizard.  Failure to do so will result in an error message,
but the software will still run fine afterwards.

Secondly, in some cases, the Search Button in the Bible Verse Lookup
goes missing.

I plan to make these corrections in the next few days and release an
update. Feel free to try and find as many bugs  as you can in 1.2.0 so
we can make 1.2.1 bug free :D

Derek.
