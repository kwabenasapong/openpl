|Mac Mini|

**Update:** We are pleased to announce that we've had another large
donation, which will cover the cost of the Mac Mini completely. Thanks
very much for the generous donations! If you would still like to donate
(it would be nice to get a Mac keyboard too), we're still accepting
donations.

As awesome as OpenLP is, we do have a rather large weak point: Our Mac
support. Presentation software integration doesn't work on Mac OS X,
there are often multiple display issues, and we don't have a dedicated
Apple/Mac developer.

The good news is that we've recently been given a large donation toward
purchasing a Mac Mini. The bad news is that it isn't enough. We need
another USD$150.

If you're interested in donating towards buying a Mac Mini, please
contact us via support<at>openlp.org or `come visit us in
IRC <http://openlp.org/support/live-chat-irc>`__ and ask for the PayPal
details.
