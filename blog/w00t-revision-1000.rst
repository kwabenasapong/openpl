I'm proud to announce that OpenLP 2.0 reached revision 1000 on Sunday
evening. That means that there are over 1000 features, improvements or
bugfixes in OpenLP 2.0.

One of the latest new features that was added to OpenLP is a Song Import
Wizard. Those who downloaded and installed Alpha 2 "Hairy Habakkak"
would have noticed that there was a Song Import Wizard in there, but it
didn't seem to work. This is because it was simply a shell, and had no
actual functionality. I'm glad to say that this has been changed, and in
Alpha 3 "Dashing Daniel" the Song Import Wizard will work.

As usual, those folks running Ubuntu or one of it's derivatives can get
revision 1000 out of our developer PPA, and those who are brave enough
to download the source code and get it up and running too. For once,
Windows users can also try out revision 1000 via a special Windows
build. Please note that this will overwrite your existing installation
of OpenLP 2.0, so make sure you make backups first.
