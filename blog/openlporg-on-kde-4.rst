I recently completely re-installed Kubuntu on my computer, so that I
could install the 64-bit version, and make use of my 64-bit processor.
With the new version of Kubuntu came KDE 4, the Linux desktop
environment that makes use of Qt4, the same User Interface toolkit we're
using for openlp.org 2.0.

In customising my KDE, I found a really nice dark theme. To my delight I
found that openlp.org uses the KDE look and feel, and so here below I've
pasted a screenshot (click on it to view it full size):
