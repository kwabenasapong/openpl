Hi All

This is a fairly minor update release, but I guess more minor to some
the others :)

| Changes in openlp.org 1.2.2.
| - Correction for bug prevent song information display from being
deactivated
| - Added option to ignore saving the unsaved OOS content when selecting
to open a new OOS
| - Fixed bug preventing the theme export to use any folder outside of
the "Documents and Settings" folder.  Themes can now be exported to any
folder.

Derek.
