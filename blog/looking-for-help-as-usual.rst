I seem to have found myself the only one left on the openlp.org "team."
All the folks who have been involved in openlp.org have had to bow out
due to external commitments. In plain english (and through no fault of
their own) they are too busy to help out.

So, I'm left asking for assistance again. If you're interested in
helping out with openlp.org (not just development - things like support,
etc), I'd really appreciate your help. You don't need to be a rocket
scientist or a rock star, you just need a couple of free hours every
week to lend a hand.

Things have been quiet here recently. About 2 weeks ago my computer's
motherboard gave in, and I was without a computer for a couple of days
while I went about ordering a new one. My computer was 5 years old,
which meant that I couldn't just replace the motherboard, I had to
replace EVERYTHING.

Otherwise, things are plodding on. I'm busy with a lot of
behind-the-scenes work at the moment, which means that there's nothing
new, just old stuff made better, but nothing really visible. This work
is very necessary though. It builds the base for future features, for
everything we want to accomplish with version 1.2. It also means fewer
bugs in the system, and more reliable performance, something I'm sure
everyone would appreciate.

That's all for now!
