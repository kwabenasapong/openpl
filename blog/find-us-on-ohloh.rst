If you haven't noticed it before, let me draw your attention to the
bottom little black bar underneath the menu on the left. This is a
little counter and a link to our project page on the Ohloh website.
Ohloh is a site where open source projects can have a project page, and
users of the software can write reviews, indicate that they use the
software, and give the developers "kudo". It's kinda like a Facebook for
open source projects.

As you can see from the counter, openlp.org currently has 183 594 lines
of code, and would cost a dedicated development team $2.5 million to
write. If you use openlp.org, and you like it, would you please consider
signing up on Ohloh and at least mark that you use it. If you'd like to,
please feel free to write a review, and giving the developers kudo is
always welcome.
