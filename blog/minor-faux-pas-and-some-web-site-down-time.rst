It seems that we made a bit of a miscalculation, as some of us thought
that the 1st of December was a Sunday. Only once we were getting closer
to the release date did we realise that it was a Saturday!

So, we're still releasing OpenLP 2.0 this weekend, just on Sunday the
2nd of December, rather than Saturday the 1st. Are you ready for version
2.0?

In semi-related news, we'll be running some maintenance on the web site
this weekend just before the release. So don't panic if see a "website
under maintenance" page, the web site will be ready for the release on
Sunday!
