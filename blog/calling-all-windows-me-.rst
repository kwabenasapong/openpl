Hi All. 

Due to the fact that neither Raoul or myself have Windows ME installed,
we are looking to all you eager volunteers who do have Windows ME to
give us a hand.  We have a reported bug where openlp.org **V1.0**
doesn't install the packaged themes properly on Windows ME, and then on
exiting throws some nasty errors.

If some of you kind people could verify whether this occurs on your
Windows ME installation we would really appreciate the input. Whether
you experience the bug or not, please include some info about your
system in the mail to us, such as version of MsOffice installed or any
other possibly relevent info.  

Mail can be sent to either Raoul *(raoul[at]openlp.org)* or myself
*(derek[at]openlp.org).*

Thanks in advance,

 Derek.
