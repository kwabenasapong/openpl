There have been changes made to Impress 3.4 which make it incompatable
with OpenLP if the Impress has been selected as a presentation player.

This is known to effect Fedora 16 and may impact other builds. Â If the
presentation plugin is enabled then OpenLP will fail to start.

More details will be provided as we find out the impact.
