Hi guys,

A BIG thank you goes out to Derek, who's been slaving away at openlp.org
adding features and removing bugs. And it's therefore our great pleasure
to give you openlp.org 1.0 beta 5.

Some things we have done:

-  Song level themes reintroduced and reported errors corrected
-  Theme name field corrected to be not writable when adding anew theme
   after editing an existing theme
-  Theme background colour bug corrected
-  "Edit/Delete the selected song" added to the right-click menu
-  "Delete author" option added to song edit dialog and add song wizard
   dialog.
-  Automatically add authors from the "add a new author" button to the
   "selected authors" box instead of requiring the user to search the
   combo box and click "add as a song author"
-  CCLI Username and password config added to settings form.
-  CCLI Number not used as SongSelect username
-  CCLI Login and song import corrected
-  CCLI search result 'next' and 'previous' buttons fixed
-  Powerpoint launched if not running when loading a presentation
-  A few corrections made to the powerpoint slide handling
-  Slides sorted alphabetically
-  Video handling corrected

I have put created a topic in the bug reports forum for bug reports:

| God bless and enjoy!
