Hi folks,

After a long time, bugfix 1.0.2 has been released. This includes a
number of minor bug fixes, as well as some performance enhancements for
presentations and slide changes. **Please note** that due to the
performance enhancements to the presentations, you will need to
re-import and presentations you have previously imported and use on a
regular basis.

You can download openlp.org 1.0.2 from the download page, as usual.

I've got a list of all the changes below:

-  Speeded up slide changes
-  Fixed error on deleting a song from the Order of Service
-  Fixed error on deleting the last slide in a song
-  Various "List index out of bounds (1)" errors fixed
-  Fixed importing of copyright information from exported songs
-  Get openlp.org to remember the last "Save As" location
-  Fixed unexpected font size change due to resizing of live and preview
   panes
-  Removed "Enabled Timed Slide" button for images
-  Fixed theme fallback for completely unset themes
-  Sped up loading of presentations
-  Fixed a bug in the theme import process
-  Fixed the theme preview in the wizard to correspond with reality
-  Bibles in drop down list are now listed alphabetically
   (case-insensitive)
-  Fixed an issue with incorrect credit lines for Bibles straight from
   the Bible manager
-  Hopefully fixed install file permissions
-  Added German and Brazillian Portuguese translations.
