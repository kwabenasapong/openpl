YES! The moment has FINALLY arrived!

We are very proud to present openlp.org version 1.0. We've waited a long
time for this, and I'm not going to lie to you, we're very excited about
this release. Over the last few years openlp.org has transformed from a
small and seemingly insignificant open source application, to the most
featureful open source lyrics projection solution (or so I've been
told).

For those of you who are eager to get hold of it, you can download it
from our download page.

Some of the features you'll find in openlp.org 1.0:

-  Projection of:

   -  Songs
   -  Bible verses
   -  PowerPoint presentations
   -  Videos
   -  Images

-  Custom slides
-  Timed congregational alerts
-  Themes:

   -  Solid colour, gradient, and image backgrounds
   -  Text shadow and outline effects

-  Translatable interface

   -  Language translations

-  Exporting:

   -  Themes

Please take this opportunity to spread the word about openlp.org.

Finally, I personally would like to extend a BIG thank you to Derek
Scotney (my partner in crime, I mean, development), Jonathan Corwin (he
likes to break openlp.org and report the bugs to us, hence becoming our
lead tester), David Bunce (heading up support, taking time to respond to
people's questions about openlp.org), Richard Banks (web hosting, and
this brilliant new site design), and all the rest of the folks in the
community that have helped us get to where we are today.

And finally, a word from the Word of Life:

|  33 Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
|            How unsearchable his judgments,
|            and his paths beyond tracing out!
|   34 "Who has known the mind of the Lord?
|            Or who has been his counselor?"
|   35 "Who has ever given to God,
|            that God should repay him?"
|   36 For from him and through him and to him are all things.
|            To him be the glory forever! Amen.

Romans 11:33-36 (New International Version)
