Yes, you read that right, it's the end of OpenLP 2.0.

No, we're not stopping development. No, 2.2 is still going to be released later in the year. No, OpenLP the project is not coming to a close, don't worry.

We're happy to announce the release of OpenLP 2.0.5, "Proselyte Paulus." This will be the last release in the 2.0 series of OpenLP.

Bugs fixed in this final release:

* Change to BibleGateway URL to use legacy web interface
* Improve PowerPoint Error handling and improve handling for v2013
* Powerpoint with video on first slide causes error
* Issues with Themes when comparing theme files
* Improved error messages with Easy Worship Song Imports
* Allow more than 26 equal verses within a Song
* Handle songs where two optional breaks follow each other
* Improve Database update error handling

As per usual, you can find the release on the `Download`_ page. If 2.0.5 isn't available for you, please try again in a day or two, some of the packages take a little while to be processed.

The next release of OpenLP will be version 2.1.1, which will be the first beta version of OpenLP 2.2.

    Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.
    2 Corinthians 5:17 ESV
