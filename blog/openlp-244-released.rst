This bugfix release is mostly just to fix the subsequent problem that some of our users have encountered when importing
songs from SongSelect. There are a couple of other bugs and minor improvements bundled into this release as well.

 | Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable
 | worship, with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire.
