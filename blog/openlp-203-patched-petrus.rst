We are happy to announce another bugfix release of OpenLP 2.0: version
2.0.3 "Patched Petrus". This release fixes a regression in OpenLP 2.0.2
where \ `services with notes could not be
saved <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1216785>`_, and includes some
updates to the translations. Windows and Mac OS X builds are on the
download page as usual, and OpenLP will filter down to the various Linux
distributions over the next week or so.

As more minor bugs are brought to our attention, we will endeavour to
make future bugfix releases of OpenLP 2.0 until OpenLP 2.2 is released.
If you think you have found a bug, please check the list of bugs on our
Launchpad.net project page to see if yours already exists in our bug
tracker: \ `OpenLP at
Launchpad.net <https://bugs.launchpad.net/openlp>`_

Speaking of OpenLP 2.2 (and on a more technical note), we have completed
the migration of OpenLP from Python 2.7 to Python 3.3. This was a big
step for us, as Python 3 is not backwards compatible with Python 2, and
we had to make some changes to the codebase to take this into
consideration.

NB: While there will be ongoing talk of OpenLP 2.2, please do not use it
for church! OpenLP 2.1 (the development version of 2.2) is unstable and
WILL crash in the middle of your service. OpenLP 2.1 is NOT compatible
with OpenLP 2.0, you may lose some or even all of your data. As soon as
the code is more stable, we will start our release cycles again with
alpha and beta releases for folks to try out.
