The openlp.org team has decided to up the ante on our marketing, but we
need your help!

We've created a Facebook Page, a group on Facebook, a Twitter account
and a group on LinkedIn (see the "Follow Us" section below the menu on
the left). We're also working hard to improve the SEO of the site.

There are a few ways you can help us out...

| Social Networking

You can help by following us on Twitter, becoming a fan of the Facebook
Page, and by joining the Facebook and LinkedIn groups. openlp.org's
Twitter page is linked to the blog on the site, so you'll always see the
latest news via Twitter, and joining the groups on social networks
allows you to network with other users of OpenLP, and with the
developers too.

Vote for OpenLP

Both Ohloh.net, a social network for open source applications, and
SourceForge.net, an open source project hosting service, offer voting
and reviewing facilities. So go and vote for OpenLP on Ohloh.net or
SourceForge.net.

| Linkage

Furthermore, if you have a blog or a web site, add a link to the
openlp.org site with the words "free church presentation software" or
"free worship software" on an appropriate page. If you're not so hot on
your HTML, we have a sample of each below.

``I use some <a href="http://openlp.org/" title="free church presentation software">free church presentation software</a> called OpenLP!``

``Looking for <a href="http://openlp.org/" title="free worship software">free worship software</a>? We use OpenLP!``
