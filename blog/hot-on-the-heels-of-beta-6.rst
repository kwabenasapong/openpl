| I am proud to announce the release of Release Candidate 1. This is the
first in our release candidate series. Once we are satisfied that no
more bugs exist in openlp.org, we will release the final version of 1.0.
Remember to post your bug reports in the forum topic.

Many thanks once again go to Derek for his part of the development of
openlp.org 1.0. I don't think we'd be where we are now without him.

Just insofar as the next version of openlp.org, we follow the Linux
kernel's versioning system, with stable releases being even numbers, and
development releases being odd numbers. So that means that the next
stable version of openlp.org will be 1.2. All new features will be in
the development version, version 1.1, while we maintain the 1.0 branch,
just bringing out bug fixes for any bugs that may still arise.

Some of the first jobs we will be doing in version 1.1 will be a major
code cleanup. This means that internally we will be tidying up the
openlp.org code, which often results in faster code, and making
openlp.org more flexible internally. We also will be moving to SQLite 3.
Currently our song and bible databases are all in SQLite 2.8 format, and
we want to upgrade to make use of the updated features in version 3.

We will obviously also bring in a number of the features that have been
requested so far. We have a nice long list of features, and we would
like to implement as many of those as is possible. Once again, however,
we will have to make a call on some features, on whether or not they
make sense to be included, and on how long they will take to implement
versus getting a product out.

Hope this helps to clear up what direction we are headed in for the
short run.Â
