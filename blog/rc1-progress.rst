As you might have noticed, openlp.org has stagnated again. My profuse
apologies, this was due to an error with PowerPoint that I was not sure
how to solve. I didn't have PowerPoint installed, so I could not figure
what the problem was.

Well, this evening I eventually **did** install PowerPoint, and
recompiled openlp.org, and it seems to have solved the problem. I also
added the CCLI license number to the slides, and fixed up a bit of the
positioning of the informational text at the bottom of the slides.

Unfortunately, there still seem to be a few issues with PowerPoint not
displaying properly, and focussing problems. I'll be meeting with Tim on
Tuesday evening to see if we can get past those last few hurdles, and
then RC1 should be good to go.

On a side note, please could you keep both Tim and myself in your
prayers.

-  Tim is due to get married in July, he's got his studies, and then he
   also has work to contend with. He's gonna be taking a much lesser
   role in the development and administration of the project due to his
   commitments.
-  I am between jobs at the moment, and with no fixed income and bills
   looming, things are not looking bright financially. I'm still
   suffering from the financial burdens of last year (including my car's
   clutch giving in which was expensive to fix), and therefore this does
   not bode well. I have a confirmed job, the company just is not yet
   ready for me (long story - mail me if you wanna know), and it's
   starting to get serious.

Thanks, and God bless!

Raoul.
