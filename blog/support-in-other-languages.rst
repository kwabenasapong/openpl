Three weeks ago we released our first beta of OpenLP 2.0, and as usage
of OpenLP becomes more widespread we have decided that it is a good time
to make some changes to the way we provide support.

Up until now we have only provided support in English due to most of the
project team being English. In light of this, we have created some new
forums for support in German, Spanish and French. We'd also like to
offer e-mail support in these languages.

We consider this an *experiment* - if the community is able to provide
support then the forums will stay open. So, if English is not your
native language, please consider helping us and volunteer by **leaving a
comment** below (or speak another language).

Cheers, Andreas

PS: This doesn't mean we're not looking for English folks to help with
support, documentation, web site maintenance and other roles within the
project.
