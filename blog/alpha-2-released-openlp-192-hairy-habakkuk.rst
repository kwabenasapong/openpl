This morning we are pleased to announce the release of OpenLP 2.0 Alpha
2!

Please remember to read through the Frequently Asked Questions before
using OpenLP - it answers many questions you might have about the new
version. The download page will be updated later today.

This release brings a number of improvements and bug fixes since release
1 as well as a lot on new features.  Since Alpha 1 there have been two
major changes which will effect those upgrading.

-  Alpha 1 Saved Service files are not compatible with the new version
-  All configuration settings will have been lost and will need to be
   set up agan. Themes are not effected by this.

New Features since Alpha 1

-  Web Interface to allow remote access.
-  Basic Song book imports have been developed and will be improved in
   later releases,  (Requires OpenOffice)
-  Many UI changes and improvements.
-  Themes now can control their line spacing.
-  UI is now translatable, thanks to the hard work from Christian
   Richter, Meinert Jordan and Frode Woldsund.
