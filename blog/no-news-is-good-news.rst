Hi folks,

We're still busy hacking away at openlp.org version 2.0, hence the
silence from us. If you don't hear from us, it's because we're working
hard!

It's coming along nicely though, we're got most of the ground work done,
and we're now busy working on how to get a plugin to display an item to
the screen. Thanks to some hard work for the team, most of the core
plugins (the Bibles, Videos, etc) are about 75% done. The next few steps
are going to be working on the openlp.org core, getting things to talk
to each other nicely and writing the control component (or "widget" as
Qt likes to call them).
