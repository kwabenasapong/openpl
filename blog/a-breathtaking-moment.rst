They carefully crept into the stable, so as not to wake the baby, and as
they entered the stable each one gasped a little. "Here he is, this
child will save us!" whispered one of the herdboys at the back of the
group to another. A feeling of awe and amazement came over them, and
they quietly but excitedly went over to the proud father and shook his
hand, and then gave the young mother a hug.

It was a breathtaking moment, right there in the stables. This little
baby, born to a poor carpenter and his young wife, would fulfill all the
prophecies of countless generations and prophets. The nation had been
waiting for this moment for more than 600 years.

    As the angel choir withdrew into heaven, the sheepherders talked it
    over. "Let's get over to Bethlehem as fast as we can and see for
    ourselves what God has revealed to us." They left, running, and
    found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger. Seeing was
    believing. They told everyone they met what the angels had said
    about this child. All who heard the sheepherders were impressed.

    Luke 2:15-18Â (The Message)

May the Lord bless you this Christmas, and remind you of what Christmas
is really all about.
