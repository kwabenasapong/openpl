Hi All

We are fast approaching the planned release of openlp.org v1.0 at the
end of this month, and we would like to put together a group of about 10
testers to put the software through it's paces to help us iron out any
last issues. We would like to have a test release available by the
middle of next week, and then run quick update cycles when issues are
found and corrected.

If you would like to take part in this activity, please mail Raoul
(raoul[at]openlp.org) to indicate your availability, as well as the
specs (OS/CPU/RAM/VIDEO etc) of the test platform you intend to use.
That way we can try and spread the testing over a range of platform
configurations.

\*\*\*Please only apply if you are willing to put in the necessary time
to do thorough testing and submit to us detailed fault scenario's to
reproduce any bugs that come up, so that we can squash them a.s.a.p.

We look forward to hearing from you.

God bless,

Derek.
