|OpenLP Android Remote|

After six months of testing, we are proud to announce the release of
Version 1.0 of the Android client.

In addition to various features and bug fixes, 6 new translations have
been added, which brings the total of supported languages to 25.

If you already have the remote client installed, you should see an
update for it. If you don't have it installed, and you want to try it
out, you can get it from the Google Play store, just search for "OpenLP"
