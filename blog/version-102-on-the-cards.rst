Over the last few months there have been a number of bug reports for
version 1.0.1. So I'm going to be spending the next week or so tracking
down the bugs and fixing them, and then releasing openlp.org 1.0.2. If
you have found any bugs, please read up on how to submit a bug, and then
check and add your bug to the 1.0.1 bug report thread in the forums.

On a side note, Martin Thompson has quietly been hacking away at
openlp.org 2.0 (the cross platform python version), and has recently
committed some code to the openlp-2 subversion repository. It's looking
good so far. If you're interested in helping him out,Â  please join us in
#openlp.org and chat to him about where you can help out.

I also want to just quickly highlight an application that Patrick
Brueckner has been working on, which will clean up various things in
your songs database file. You can download it from his website.
