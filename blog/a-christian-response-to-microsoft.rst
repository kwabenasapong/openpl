As you may or may not know, my primary desktop system runs Kubuntu
Linux. I do this because Linux is far more stable, it's virus-free, it
has far superior security, and in general is more user friendly. It's
also updated frequently (every 6 months in the case of Kubuntu), any
security flaws that are found are patched immediately (including my
system downloading and installing those patches), and it's 100% free to
boot. As such, I like to promote Linux as an alternative to Windows.

Recently I came across a "rant" - a person venting their frustration -
on a Dutch chap's site. It is unlike a normal rant because not only is
the length of a dissertation, but it's also well thought out and well
written. Most rants are irrantional, illogical and full of insults; this
rant was the complete opposite. And what was the rant about? It was
about Microsoft.

I urge you to read this document. You can find it at:
http://www.vanwensveen.nl/rants/microsoft/IhateMS.html. It's a very
honest and factual essay on Microsoft. As you read it, I encourage you
to think about what a Christian response to Microsoft would be. Should
we as Christians actually be using their software? Should we be
endorsing a company like that through using their software?

It says in Philippians 4:8-9: "8Finally, brothers, whatever is true,
whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is
lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or
praiseworthy—think about such things. 9Whatever you have learned or
received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the
God of peace will be with you. "

My question is this: Is Microsoft a company you want to associate with
as a Christian, as a member of the Church? Are they "true, noble, right,
pure lovely or admirable"?

I would recommend that you show print out this document and show it to
your pastors and those involved in the leadership of your church. Ask
them to think about what I've said.
