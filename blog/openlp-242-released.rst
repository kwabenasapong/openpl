OpenLP 2.4 has still proven to be been surprisingly bug-free. Apart from some known issues with video, we've had very
few actual bug reports. But that doesn't mean there haven't been any bug reports, or any bugs to be fixed. So, without
much further ado, here's OpenLP 2.4.2, the second of the bugfix releases of OpenLP 2.4.

The translations have been updated to the latest versions.

Bugs fixed in 2.4.2:

- `#1579648`_ BibleStudyTools import broken
- `#1588369`_ Projector Won't Connect in OpenLP
- `#1582152`_ SongPro import fails with traceback
- `#1585489`_ Traceback during songshowplus import
- `#1589815`_ OpenSong files with non-numeric CCLI cause an exception
- `#1593882`_ Projector authenticated connection generates exception
- `#1593883`_ Projector not connecting with authentication
- `#1594945`_ VideoPsalm import with control chars or escaped quotes causes traceback

    So let's not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we
    don't give up. Therefore, whenever we have the opportunity, we should do good to everyone-especially to those
    in the family of faith.

    Galatians 6:9-10 NLT
