Hi folks, we've just added a jabber server to our system, so that now
you can contact us on our openlp.org jabber accounts. My jabber ID is
raoul (at) openlp.org and Derek can be contacted on derek (at)
openlp.org.

Also, we're nearly ready to release RC4. Both Derek and myself have been
really busy, and I'm just busy working on the image resizing tweaks, and
then we'll release RC4.Â
