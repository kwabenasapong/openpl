As we continue to work towards a shorter release cycle, we have started releasing bug fixes and translation updates on a more frequent basis.

With this in mind, we'd like to release version 2.4.2 in about 3 weeks time. This version will have all the latest bug fixes, but we would also like to release updated translations. If you're a translator, now is your opportunity to get your translation up to date.

We'll be sending out updates via our developer mailing list, so make sure you sign up and keep your ear to the ground.
