Hi All

No doubt most of you are as keen as we are to get openlp.org into a full
version 1 status. Well, we are nearly there. Sorry about the few hiccups
in the last few releases, they were due to last minute corrections and
optimisations in the software and slipped though due to the fact that we
were trying to honour our release date promises.

With this in mind we would like to make the RC2 release on the 15th/16th
of June and we appeal to all of you out there to give the software a
thorough testing in the next week or so, so that RC2 can be our last
release candidate. I should mention at this stage that there is a rather
unpleasant **bug in rc1** regarding the **loading of saved
Orders-Of-Service**. This has been corrected and will be in RC2, so
please don't highlight this problem in your feedback. To work around
this, you need to rebuild the OOS each time before you use it.
Frustrating I know. Sorry!

You can post bug reports in the openlp.org 1.0 rc1 forum topic.Â 

We do appreciate all your feedback, and without your input, openlp.org
wouldn't be where is is today.

Derek.
