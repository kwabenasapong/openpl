Hi to all since this is my first blog entry since joining this project
as part of the development team, and thanks to Raoul for his guidance
and support.

As you know by now, we have frozen the featureset for the current
version of OpenLP.org which we are trying hard to get into a v1 release
as soon as possible.  There have been some great idea's from you guys,
and we are keeping them all on record for after the v1 release.  We are
even putting some of our own idea's on the back burner for now.

So...what's next. Well, there are 4 main issues on the table for the
next, and hopefully last, beta release (beta5). These are:

| 1) The translation feature
| 2) Fixing the CCLI SongSelect
| 3) Putting back the song theme assignment
| 4) Getting the video working

With regard to the Video feature, there is a possible workaround which I
am using successfully at the moment.  If you have a relatively recent
nVidia display card, there is a setting for "Full screen video".  If you
set the "Full screen device" to "auto-select", the card automatically
routes the video to the second display.  I had this setting unknowingly
set on my development machine and couldn't figure out why video wasn't
working on other machines.  Anyway, you can try this workaround and see
if it works for you.

I'm sure you are all eager to know when to expect the next beta.  Raoul
and I have had a chat and we are planning it for early in the New Year. 
I know that sounds a bit vague, but the translation feature is an
immense amount of work and the video is a bit tricky since we are not
DirectX experts.

Well, that's how things stand at the moment.  We appreciate all the
comments and feedback.

God bless,

Derek.
