Hi folks,

When we released openlp.org 1.0, we hinted at a bugfix release soon
after, to clear up any bugs that were still in that release, and true to
our word, we've been working on openlp.org 1.0.1. We got our testing
team to mercilessly attempt to break openlp.org in a bid to find as many
bugs as possible. And we got them...

After a few rounds of test -> fix -> test -> fix, I think we're almost
done, and I'm hoping to release openlp.org 1.0.1 in about 2 weeks time.

After 1.0.1 we're going full steam ahead on version 1.1, the development
version of 1.2. As we go along, we'll have a few releases (1.1.0, 1.1.1,
1.1.2, etc) so that those who want to run a bleeding edge version of
openlp.org can. For the rest of you who prefer stability and
reliability, we would suggest you stick with 1.0.1 until 1.2 itself
comes out.

We've also had offers from another 2 folks to help us out with 1.1, and
so we're looking forward to a slightly faster development pace, although
we can't make any promises.

That's all from us for the moment. In the mean time, click on the
Ohloh.net button at the bottom of the left hand column of the site, and
let the world know that you use openlp.org by signing up and "stacking"
openlp.org!
