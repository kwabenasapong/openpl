Hello everyone! OpenLP's popularity is on the rise. We just hit 1,200
fans. That is a large accomplishment in itself for a project like
OpenLP. With this rise in popularity we could use some help from the
community. As you probably already know we have been hard at work on a
manual and support is always available through chat, but OpenLP also has
a YouTube channel. Many times a video is worth more than a thousand
words when demonstrating a feature or helping out with a technical
issue.

We would love for members of the OpenLP community to help out with
support. We can always use help with the manual or in chat, but
specifically we would love to have your videos. Maybe you would like to
document a feature that once found you couldn't live without. Maybe, you
are a pro at setting up OpenLP and dual monitors and would like to
demonstrate. If you would like a sample of a video please check this
video out.

If you have your cameras rolling email us at support@openlp.org with
your video and we will link to it on YouTube. If you do not have the
video posted online and would still like to get it to us, file syncing
services such as Dropbox, UbuntuOne, and Spider Oak (to name a few) all
have a way to share a file with a public link. If that isn't your cup of
tea you can also use a site such as TransferBigFiles.com to upload a
file and have a public link so others can access it.

If you have been looking for a way to help the OpenLP community out this
would be a great way and also should be fun in the process!
