Hi guys,

just a quick message to show you a screen of what openlp.org in C++ is
looking like. As you can see, most of the main window is implemented -
and it'll all work just like you're used to. And remember, it's all been
developed with totally free/open source tools, and will run on Mac,
Linux and Windows!
