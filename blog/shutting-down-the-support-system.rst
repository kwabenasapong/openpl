I have decided to shut down the support system. It's getting too much for me, I am spending most of my time answering
people's e-mails instead of working on OpenLP, and I've largely been the only person answering support e-mails. I'm
really sad to do this, as I feel it's one of the defining parts of OpenLP (our support), but in reality I have no other
choice. My time is limited (and only getting more so), and I'd rather spend that time improving OpenLP.

In future anyone who e-mails support@openlp.org will get a message that redirects them to the manual and the forums.
