Well, thanks to Derek's sharp eyes, we've managed to weed out a few more
bugs, and now all that remains is some minor testing from us to make
sure there are no show-stopper bugs, and then on Sat (12 May) I will
release beta 6.

Please note that we have not yet managed to fix the CCLI SongSelect
problem. That was a hack at best, and now CCLI have changed their
authentication method on the SongSelect, which means that we can no
longer log in. We're gonna have a look at that "bug" in the release
candidates, but Derek and I are leaning toward just leaving it broken
until the next version of openlp.org. Then we'll have a look at it
again.
