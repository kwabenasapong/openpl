Many thanks to Joseph Mulloy and Alexandre D. Rogoski who have worked
hard to get OpenLP up and running on openSUSE!

A couple of developers have tried in the past, and run into various
issues, but between Joseph and Alexandre, they have managed to overcome
these issues, and give us a One-Click Install for openSUSE 12.1, 11.4
and 11.3.

You can download OpenLP for openSUSE by visiting the download page and
clicking on the link for your version of openSUSE.

Please note that you will not be able to import songs or Bibles from
openlp.org 1.x as dependencies for this functionality are not present
within openSUSE. Should you need this, please e-mail your database to
support[at]openlp.org and the support team will try to convert them for
you.
