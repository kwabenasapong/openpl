We're arranging another developer meeting in the #openlp.org IRC channel
to discuss openlp.org version 2.x. We've tentatively arranged it for
Monday 19th May at 20:00 GMT. Since I know that time zones have changed
recently in some countries, if an alternate time would suit you, please
let us know on the openlp-devel mailing list or in a private message to
me on the site.

On a side note, we're fixing up the last few bugs in 1.0.1 and are
hoping to release it soon. I know I've said that a few times already,
but both Derek and myself have been really busy and tied up with work
recently, and haven't had much of a chance to work on openlp.org. As you
know, we do this all in our spare time, thanks to our very patient wives
and families.

Please keep Derek in your prayers, things at his workplace are not that
great, resulting in him sometimes still being at work at 9pm in the
evening. I'm really impressed that he manages to get time to work on
openlp.org, and I'm really amazed at his level of dedication.
