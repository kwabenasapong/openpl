Well, sometimes that's how I feel. I'm starting to get bogged down with
wedding preparations, never mind the extra bit of part time work that I
have on the side (any extra income at the moment is needed) which takes
my evenings and my Saturdays away.

I've noticed that we're getting more and more support requests in via
our support(at)openlp.org address. Please remember that our primary
support line is through the forums. Unfortunately we don't have the
resources to cope with the all support requests. So we need people to
help us there.

Also, we need more people in the forums to take on a more active role.
Those forums are not for you to ask questions and us to answer, we're
hoping that more experienced people can answer questions too.

And then again we still need people to help with documentation. I
honestly don't want to spend my honeymoon writing documentation. That's
the only free time I'm gonna have in the next 3 months.

I'm sorry if this sounds like a rant, but I'm getting a little tired of
being a one-man-show here. If you really like our software, and you
wanna show us some grattitude, please get involved. You don't need a PhD
in computer science to help out. You just need a willing heart and an
hour a week that you can spend on openlp.org.
