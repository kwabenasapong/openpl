Hi folks,

It is with great pleasure that I announce the first alpha version of
OpenLP 2.0! We've been working on this for a long time (since September
2008 if I have my dates correct) and decided to give everyone a taste of
what we've been working on.

As we've mentioned before, OpenLP 2.0 is cross-platform. This means that
it runs on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and even FreeBSD! However, since
OpenLP 2.0 is a complete rewrite, and this particular release is an
Alpha, there are a few things to be aware of...

From our FAQ: What is an alpha release?

An alpha release is a very early incomplete release. It has missing
features, and bugs and is likely to crash or do unexpected things. It is
intended for those who aren't scared of program crashes and want to help
test the software. It is also for those who are interested in seeing the
new features.

What new features will I find in 2.0?

Since 2.0 is a rewrite from the ground up, you won't find a great deal
of new features since initially we want to ensure all the v1.2 features
are included. However the developers have managed to sneak a few in.
Take a look at the Complete list.

Is there a manual or any documentation for 2.0?

No, we don't have any documentation yet. If you need help, just ask in
the forums or use the live chat feature. If you would like to help write
some documentation, please let us know - we are always happy for new
volunteers to join the team and contribute to the project.

I've started OpenLP, but I can't see the songs or bibles section in the
Media Manager

On some systems, the media manager plugins default to a deactivated
state. This is something we will address in a future release, but for
now you will need to turn them on manually.
