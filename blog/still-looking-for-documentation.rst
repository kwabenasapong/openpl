We're still looking for people to help out with the documentation.
That's the final part in the "release" of openlp.org. Unfortunately
neither Derek nor myself have the time at the moment to do that, so we'd
really appreciate the help.

You don't need to be able to devote 3 hours per day to it, all we need
is a few people who can each complete one part, and then we'll be more
than halfway there. If you reckon you can write up a "how to" on
something like adding a song or creating a new theme, or any one of the
many tasks and actions in openlp.org, please let me know.

So if we can get about 20 people just writing up 1 section each, then
we'll have 20 sections done, and it's taken maybe an hour of your time.

You can either use the contact form, or contact me directly at
raoul-at-openlp.org.Â
