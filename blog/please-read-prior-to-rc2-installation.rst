Due to an unforseen glitch with a fault correction, Powerpoint is not
functioning in the RC2 release.  We are aware of the problem and it has
been corrected.  Unfortunately, we cannot provide a correction release
immediately, as there is an  incomplete feature enhancement in the
software.  Once this enhancement is completed, we will provide the
correction in RC3.  You can expect that hopefully towards the end of the
month.  Sorry for the inconvenience if you use Powerpoint.

God bless, 

Derek.
