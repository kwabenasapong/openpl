We have decided to delay the release of OpenLP 1.9.4 (aka 2.0 Alpha 4)
for two weeks, till the 9th of January. Due to some unforseen technical
difficulties (namely my Internet connection at home giving up the
ghost), we have been unable to fully prepare for the release.

By delaying the release for 2 weeks, we hope to give the translators a
chance to get their translations up to speed, and give the testers and
developers a chance to iron out most of the remaining bugs. This will
hopefully ensure that we have a well-rounded release.
