In version 2 of there is a pluging called "SongUsage" which records all
**Live** songs and when they were used.  This is to help with the
production of yearly usage returns.

The Plugin geneates a CSV file which can be procesed using OpenOffice.

This can replace the existing utility which extracts the data from the
service files.
